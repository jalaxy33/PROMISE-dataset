context_example
--------------
This is a demonstration of 2 different context implementations :
 - a context implementation that uses a database as the storage.
   Use the DBContextTest program to test.  See the DBContextTest.java file for the 
   db table info.  Unsupported demonstration code.  You may need to futz with 
   it to get it to work in your environment.  To run, use the dbcontexttest.sh 
   script.
 - a context implementation that uses a TreeMap for storage.  Very simple.


Thanks for using Velocity!
