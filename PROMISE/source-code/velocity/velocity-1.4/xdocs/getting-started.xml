<section name="Getting Started">

<p>
  It's easy to get started with Velocity.   The best places to start are

  <ul>
   <li>
      The <a href="user-guide.html">User's Guide</a>, which provides a good
      overview of what Velocity templates are all about.
   </li>
   <li>
     The <a href="developer-guide.html">Developer's Guide</a>, which provides
     a good reference and discussion of incorporating Velocity into your Java
     programs and servlets.
   </li>
   <li>
     The <a href="vtl-reference-guide.html">VTL Reference Guide</a>, which is a reference
     guide for VTL, the Velocity Template Language.
   </li>
   <li>
     The <a href="design.html">Design</a> document, which provides a high-level overview
     of the how Velocity works, and why it's important.
    </li>
   </ul>

   And of course, the best place to start is with the examples provided with the distribution,
   and the source code itself, which is included.
</p>

<p>
    Instructions for downloading and installing Velocity can be found on the
    <a href="install.html">Install</a> document.
</p>

</section>

<section name="API Documentation">

<p>
Our API documentation is available <a href="api/index.html">online</a>, 
as part of the distribution package, and of course, you can generate it
yourself from the included sources.
</p>
<p>
    If you would like to create a full set
    of detailed API documentation for Velocity, go to the
    <code>build</code> directory and run:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
ant javadocs
]]></source>

<p>
The docs will be found in the <code>/docs/apidocs/</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Velocity uses the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Jakarta Ant</a> 
build tool for all code and documentation generation, so you will need to have it 
installed.  We strongly endorse this wonderful tool for any Java developer.
