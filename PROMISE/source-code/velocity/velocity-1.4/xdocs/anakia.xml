<section name="What Is Anakia?">
<p>
    Essentially an XML transformation tool, Anakia uses <a
    href="http://www.jdom.org">JDOM</a> and <a
    href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">Velocity</a> to transform
    XML documents into the format of your choice. It provides an alternative to
    using Ant's &lt;style&gt; task and
    <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/">XSL</a> to process XML
    files.
</p>
<p>
   The basic model that AnakiaTask uses is pretty straightforward : 
   <ol>
   <li>Parse your XML into a JDOM Document:<br/>
<pre>SAXBuilder builder;
Document root = null;

try 
{
    builder = new SAXBuilder( 
        "org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser" );
    root = builder.build( file );
}
catch( Exception )
{
    System.out.println( ...  );
}</pre></li>

    <li>Stuff the Document (or root Element) into the context:<br/>
<pre>context.put("root", root );</pre></li>

    <li>Render a template using Velocity. Within the template, one
        can use JDOM's methods to access the data contained in the
        XML document.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    Anakia is potentially easier to learn than XSL, but it maintains a
    similar level of functionality. Learning cryptic &lt;xsl:&gt; tags
    is unnecessary; you only need to know how to use the provided
    Context objects, JDOM, and Velocity's simple directives. Anakia
    seems to perform much faster than Xalan's XSL processor at creating
    pages. (23 pages are generated in 7-8 seconds on a PIII 500mhz
    running Win98 and JDK 1.3 with client Hotspot. A similar system
    using Ant's &lt;style&gt; task took 14-15 seconds -- nearly a 2x
    speed improvement.)
</p>
<p>
    Anakia -- intended to replace Stylebook, which was originally used
    to generate simple, static web sites in which all pages had the same
    look and feel -- is great for documentation/project web sites, such
    as the sites on <a href="http://www.apache.org/">www.apache.org</a> 
    and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">jakarta.apache.org</a>. As it 
    is more targeted to a specific purpose, it does not provide some of 
    XSL's &quot;extra&quot; functionality.
</p>
<p>
    The example in the jakarta-velocity/examples/anakia directory
    provides a good introduction to Anakia. You should find it quite
    simple to use.
</p>
<p>
    Anakia creates a Context, which contains a JDOM Document object of
    the .xml page, as well as an (optional) JDOM Document object of your
    project.xml page. The .vsl page is executed (using Velocity) with
    the Context. You can then navigate your .xml file and pull
    information out of it by simply executing methods on the JDOM
    Document object.
</p>
<p>
    Anakia is being used to create the documentation for not only this
    website, but also for the Jakarta Project's website as well as 
    many of the projects that live under the Jakarta Project. This 
    process is 
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/jakarta-site2.html">documented</a> 
    on the site. You are welcome to use this for your own needs as well.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Installation/Example">
<p>
    Before reviewing the jakarta-velocity/examples/anakia directory,
    you must <a href="install.html">build Velocity</a>.
</p>
<p>
    After building Velocity, <code>cd</code> into the
    jakarta-velocity/examples/anakia/build directory and run 'ant'.
</p>
<p>
    Output from running ant, in this case HTML files, is placed
    into the jakarta-velocity/examples/anakia/docs/ directory.
</p>
<p>
    The jakarta-velocity/examples/anakia/xdocs/ directory has all of the
    .xml source code. The xdocs/stylesheets directory contains the .vsl
    file, in which most of the magic happens. Understanding <a
    href="user-guide.html">Velocity Template Language</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a> is
    necessary to understand how the .vsl file works.
</p>
</section>

<section name="How does it work?">

<p>
    Anakia is an Ant task that executes from an Ant build file. The
    build file looks something like this:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
    <project name="build-site" default="docs" basedir=".">
    <property name="docs.src" value="../xdocs"/>
    <property name="docs.dest" value="../docs"/>

    <target name="prepare">
        <available classname="org.apache.velocity.anakia.AnakiaTask"
        property="AnakiaTask.present"/>
    </target>

    <target depends="prepare" name="prepare-error" unless="AnakiaTask.present">
        <echo>
            AnakiaTask is not present! Please check to make sure that
            velocity.jar is in your classpath.
        </echo>
    </target>

    <target name="docs" depends="prepare-error" if="AnakiaTask.present">
        <taskdef name="anakia" classname="org.apache.velocity.anakia.AnakiaTask"/>
        <anakia basedir="${docs.src}" destdir="${docs.dest}/"
             extension=".html" style="./site.vsl"
             projectFile="./stylesheets/project.xml"
             excludes="**/stylesheets/**"
             includes="**/*.xml"
             lastModifiedCheck="false"
             velocityPropertiesFile="velocity.properties">
        </anakia>

        <copy todir="${docs.dest}/images" filtering="no">
            <fileset dir="${docs.src}/images">
                <include name="**/*.gif"/>
                <include name="**/*.jpeg"/>
                <include name="**/*.jpg"/>
            </fileset>
        </copy>
    </target>
</project>

<section name="Context Objects">
<p>
    The Anakia Ant task places several objects into the Context for you.
    Right now, you do not have control over what is placed into the
    Context. Eventually, we hope to have a way to give you control over
    this. However, that does not prevent Anakia from being extremely
    useful for you today. :-) The objects that are available to you in
    your .vsl template are:
</p>

    <table border="0">
        <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$root</td>
            <td>This contains the JDOM root Element to your .xml document. When
            this (or any other variable containing an element) are simply
            placed into template output, their XML form is rendered.</td>
        </tr>

            <td>$project</td>

            <td>This context object will convert HTML Entities in the
            $string that is passed into it and it will return the

            entities that are converted are: &quot; -> &amp;quot; | &lt;

            $xmlout.outputString(Element). Again, please look at the
            examples for more information on how to use this
            object. NOTE: this object is obsoleted as simply specifying
            $element will output the XML serialized form of the element.</td>

            output all of the Elements <strong>within</strong> the
            passed in Element. So, if you pass in a &lt;td&gt; Element,
            you will get everything inside the &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;, but
            not the actual &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;. NOTE: this object is
            obsoleted as simply specifying $element.content will produce the
            desired output.

        <tr>
            <td>$treeWalk.allElements($element)</td>
            <td>This will allow you to walk a tree of JDOM Element

            you can look at each Element node conditionally and set its
            content and attribute values. This is probably one of the
            more &quot;ugly&quot; aspects of Anakia, but it does do the
            job and suggestions for improvement are appreciated. This
            context object is still under development and more
            documentation will follow soon. NOTE: this object is obsolete and
            is kept for backward compatibility only. You can use

               </a> refers to NodeSets repeatedly, but this implementation
               simply uses java.util.List to hold all Nodes. A 'Node' is any
               object in a JDOM object tree, such as an org.jdom.Element,
               org.jdom.Document, or org.jdom.Attribute. Please see the .vsl

    All node lists returned from Anakia objects through $element.selectNodes,
    $element.content, and $element.children, as well as through obsoleted 
    $treeWalk.allElements and $xpath.applyTo have two special features:
    <ul>
        <li>they support the selectNodes method just as a single element does
        that applies an XPath expression to all nodes in the list, and</li>
        <li>when inserted into template output by simply specifying $list, they
        produce the XML fragment consisting of all nodes they contain. This
        eliminates much of the #foreach code in templates.</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    Anakia was originally conceptualized and implemented by 
        <a href="mailto:jon@latchkey.com">Jon S. Stevens</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The name <a
    href="http://www.kabalarians.com/female/anakia.htm">Anakia</a> is a
    cool name that I think fits this project quite nicely. "The name of
    Anakia has given you the desire for creative, artistic or musical
    expression in an original way. You strive to be different and have
    the self-confidence to implement your ideas because you have the
    perseverance necessary to see something through, despite obstacles."
</p>
<p>
    Further help and assistance was provided by Jason van Zyl and Geir
    Magnusson Jr. XPath support was added by Bob McWhirter. The more
    intuitive syntax achieved through selectNodes() and self-rendering
    elements and node lists was added by Attila Szegedi.
