<section name="Velocity and Development Tools">

<p>
   We have three contributions from the user community to help make developing with
   Velocity easier and more convenient.
</p>

<subsection name="IntelliJ IDEA">

<p>
 Rickard Oberg (rickard@xpedio.com) has contributed templates for the
 <a href="http://www.intellij.com/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> IDE.
 </p>

 <p>
 They can  be found
 <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-velocity/contrib/tools/intellij/">
 here</a> in the Velocity CVS, or can be found in the /contrib/tools directory
 of the source tree.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="UltraEdit Editor">

<p>
Herve Guidetti (Herve.Guidetti@idbsoft.ch) contributed a 'word.txt' addition
(with  tweaks and comments by Wido Hillmann (wido.hillmann@epost.de) )
for the <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">UltraEdit</a> programmers editor.
</p>

<p>
 It can  be found
 <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-velocity/contrib/tools/ultraedit/">
 here</a> in the Velocity CVS, or can be found in the /contrib/tools directory
 of the source tree.
</p>

<p>
To add this to your UltraEdit configuration :
<ol>
<li> Go into UltraEdit home directory.</li>
<li> Add the content of the file to the end of your word.txt file. </li>
<li> Modify the number on the first line (/L9 in this case), so that it matches
your word.txt definition. (it's incremental)</li>
<li> Edit a .vm template with UltraEdit. You should now have syntax coloring
for Velocimacros.</li>
</ol>
</p>


</subsection>

<subsection name="JEdit">

<p>
Saimon Moore (smoore@serikat.es) contributed a Velocity mode for the java-based
editor <a href="http://www.jedit.org">JEdit</a>, and can be found here in
<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-velocity/contrib/tools/jedit/">
velocity.xml</a>.
</p>

<p>
To install, add the velocity.xml to one of your 'mode' directories,
and add the following to that directory's catalog file :
<pre>
&lt;MODE NAME="velocity"  FILE="velocity.xml"
		       FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.vw" /&gt;
</pre>
and restart JEdit.  If there are any problems with installation,
see the JEdit documentation about 'Modes'.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="TextPad">

<p>
Jeff Linwood (jeff@greenninja.com) created a simple syntax definition for
Velocity for the <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">TextPad</a> editor, which
can be found <a href="http://www.textpad.com/add-ons/synu2z.html">here</a>.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Emacs">

<p>
Brian Leonard (brian@brainslug.org) contributed a minor mode that does
font-locking (syntax coloring) of VTL in emacs.  As a minor mode, it
insinuates itself into whatever major mode you're using, so you don't lose
the major mode's goodness. It can be found
<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-velocity/contrib/tools/emacs/">
here</a>.
