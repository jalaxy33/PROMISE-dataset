<strong>Hey, Maybe We're On The Right Track After All...</strong>
<blockquote>
Give <a href="http://www.caucho.com/products/resin/ref/velocity.xtp">this</a>
a read.  The latest version of <a href="http://www.caucho.com/">Resin</a>, a
popular servlet engine, has added what they call a "Velocity-like syntax" to their JSP
implementation.  As they say on their site :
<blockquote>
<i>"The Resin-2.0.3 release allows an alternate JSP expression syntax similar to the Apache Velocity project that many find more maintainable than the JSP pointy brackets. Resin's syntax extension is compatible with the usual JSP features like tag libraries."
</i>
</blockquote>

We do think that this is a step in the right direction for JSPs, making the page content easier to
write and maintain.
<br/>
<br/>
However, we want to emphasize to users that this isn't the same thing as using
Velocity - this is a small subset of the Velocity syntax which
was reimplemented in Resin.
<br/>
<br/>
 Velocity is much more than an alternative syntax to the scriptlets and
tags found in JSPs - it's a full-featured templating engine, fully portable to any
J2EE servlet container, that offers many advanges over JSPs in the J2EE
web application environment.  It also an excellent templating tool
for other kinds of applications written in Java.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you are interested in portable alternatives to JSP, we strongly
encourage you look deeper into what Velocity has to offer.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you must use JSPs and want to incorporate Velocity into your
current or new JSP-based web applications, take a look at our
<a href="veltag.html">Veltag</a> JSP taglib which allows the full
power of Velocity in your JSPs.

<strong>Velocidoc Released</strong>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://velocidoc.sourceforge.net/intro.html">
Velocidoc</a>, a Velocimacro documentation tool modeled after
Javadoc, is now available.  Use Javadoc-style comments in your
Velocimacro libraries, and use Velocidoc to generate HTML
documentation.

<strong>New Apache Site Generated with Anakia</strong>
<blockquote>
The new web site of the
<a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>
is now generated using
<a href="anakia.html">Anakia</a>,
the Velocity-based XML transformation tool.
Take a look.

<strong>4 published articles covering Velocity</strong>
</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2001/09/serv/">Getting Up
to Speed with Velocity</a> is a really well written article by Jim
Jagielski about the merits of using a tool like Velocity.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Many people believe that Velocity can only be used in the context of web
applications. This excellent <a
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-2001/jw-0727-templates.html">JavaWorld
article</a> by Leon Messerschmidt shows that the design of Velocity is
such that it can be used in a myriad of applications.

<blockquote>
The Java Developer Journal recently <a
href="http://www.sys-con.com/java/articlea.cfm?id=1080">published</a> an
edited version of the <a href="./ymtd/ymtd.html">YMTD article</a> by Jon
Stevens as the cover story for their July edition.
