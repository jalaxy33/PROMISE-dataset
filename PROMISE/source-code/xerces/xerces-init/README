Build Instructions:

To build Xerces Java on Windows, you need a copy of Cygnus's Cygwin.
See http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin.   Once Cygwin is installed,
you need to set two environment variables.  Edit the batch file
BuildAll.bat to set these variables.  Execute BuildAll.bat, and then
set your classpath to point to the src and samples directories in the
Xerces Java distribution.  You can then go to the top of the Xerces
Java tree and type 'make'. 

To build Xerces Java on UNIX, you need to set an environment
variable. Edit the shell script BuildAll to set this variables.  
Execute BuildAll, and then set your classpath to point to the src 
and samples directories in the Xerces Java distribution.  You can then
go to the top of the Xerces Java tree and type 'make'.
