This drop of Xerces is based on a development version of the IBM XML4J
code base.  There are lots of things that need to be done:

* integrate cool stuff from OpenXML and Project X

* continued tracking of the W3C Schema Language working drafts
* support for DOM Level 2 ranges
* support for DTD caching
* a total rework of the makefile/build system
* close outstanding bugs
* DOM performance work
