  <audience title="Intended Audience">

<warning>
"Views" are new functionality which is still in development phase. That is why it is in the
"whiteboard" section of the Forrest distribution.
This HowTo is far from being finished. 
</warning>

    <p>
      This part of the views is dedicated to webdesigner and user with some knowlegde of css.
    </p>
  </audience>
  
  <purpose title="Purpose">
    <p>
      This how-to will show you how to write a<strong> forrest:view</strong>  from ground on. 
      We will focus on html as output format. As well it will show how to add your own css implementation to the view.
    </p>
  </purpose>

  <prerequisites title="Prerequisites">
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have a ready-to-go new seed (newSeed) based on views like described in <a href="site:howto/view/install">Install views</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
      	This includes as well all additional plugins that are mentioned in <a href="site:howto/view/install">Install views</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading that how-to is as well a good idea to understand the used dir-structure in this how-to.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </prerequisites>

  <steps title="Steps">
    <note>
      When developing with views we assume you are using 'forrest run' and the following workflow:<br/>
      change files -> refresh browser
    </note>
    <p>
      We developed<strong> forrest:view</strong>  to let the user decide where to place elements in e.g. html-pages.
      We started this work with the <code>skinconf.xml</code> where you could configure certain elements and
      their positions. This elements was known under certain names. It was up to the skin-designer to support 
      this configuration and the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
     The work started with grouping elements (the ones from skinconf). We used css-contracts that 
     we added as @attributes e.g. <code><![CDATA[<div id="content-main"/>]]> </code>. That made it 
     possible to use the same elements in different skins. For the full list refer to the
      <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/forrest/trunk/main/webapp/skins/leather-dev/contracts.inicial.txt">
        inicial contract list
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     Around this contracts we developed a configuration Domain Specific Language and called it<strong> forrest:view</strong> .
    <strong> forrest:view</strong> 's allows us to define the order in which <strong>forrest:contract</strong>'s appear, and also to group
     them using <strong>forrest:hook</strong>'s.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>forrest:hook</strong>'s are container that are only used for layout reasons. They <strong>do not</strong> add 
     any content nor functionality to the output. They add <strong>only</strong> layout information to 
     the output. Actually a <code><![CDATA[<forrest:hook name="layoutId"/>]]></code> will be transformed
     to <code><![CDATA[<div id="layoutId"/>]]> </code>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>forrest:contract</strong>'s are functionality or extra content that a skin can use to display the requested
     document (content-main). Sometimes a contract delivers <strong>format-specific markup</strong>, other times it delivers
     a <strong>format-independent string</strong>.
    </p>
    <section id="emptyView">
      <title>Empty view file</title>
      <source><![CDATA[<forrest:views xmlns:forrest="http://apache.org/forrest/templates/1.0" >
  <forrest:view type="xhtml">    
  </forrest:view>  
</forrest:views>]]>
      </source>
      <p>
       <strong> forrest:view</strong>  is designed to be open for any format that can use<strong> forrest:view</strong>  as configuration file.
	The only format we implemented is xhtml for now. This is as well true for the delivered contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now lets start to skin our site. :)
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="firstView">
			<title>Creating your first view</title>
			<p>
				In this section we will create a new view. We will override the default view of the view-plugin
        for the index page of the <a href="site:howto/view/install">newSeed</a>.
        For that we will create a file called <code>index.ft</code> and save it in our xdocs directory. 
        This will make <strong>only</strong> the index.html page look different from the rest of the project.
			</p>
      <p>
        Remember: pointing your browser to <code>http://localhost:8888/ls.contracts.html</code> will
        show a page with all contracts that you can use in your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let use the blank view from the earlier step and add the content-main contract. In 
        ls.contracts.html we find the information how to use the contract in our view. Our 
        <code>index.fv</code> should look like:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[<forrest:views xmlns:forrest="http://apache.org/forrest/templates/1.0" >
  <forrest:view type="xhtml">    
    <forrest:contract name="content-main"/>
  </forrest:view>  
</forrest:views>]]>
      </source>
      <p>
        Let's try our new view by pointing to <code>http://localhost:8888/index.html</code>. 
        We will see only the main content. :) Now let's add the section navigation to our view.
        The contract usage in the view can be looked up in ls.contracts.html. Our view now looks like:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[<forrest:views xmlns:forrest="http://apache.org/forrest/templates/1.0" >
  <forrest:view type="xhtml">    
    <forrest:contract name="content-main"/>
    <forrest:contract name="nav-section"/>
  </forrest:view>  
</forrest:views>]]>
      </source>
      <p>
        We find now the main content and the section navigation after each other and in the order 
        we placed them in the view, but we want it next to each other 
        (left: nav-section; right: content-main).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="hookView">
      <title>Hooks in views</title>
      <p>
        We will use now the first time a <code><![CDATA[<forrest:hook name="layoutId"/>]]></code>.
        Hooks are the styling side of views. We can imitate arbitrary html skeleton 
        with their help. Before we explain how to use your own css in views we will use the default css.
        In the default.css we can find 
      </p>
      <source>/* menu */
#leftbar {
    width: 25%;
    float: left;
    background: #eae8e3;
    border: thin dashed #565248;
}
      </source>
      <p>
        With this information we know to use <code><![CDATA[<forrest:hook name="leftbar"/>]]></code> 
        and add contracts into that container. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If we want to put the nav-section contract into the left side position
        of the site we need to place the contract into that hook. Like:
      </p> 
      <source><![CDATA[<forrest:hook name="leftbar">
  <forrest:contract name="nav-section"/>
</forrest:hook>]]>
			</source>
      <p>
        Our view will then look like:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[<forrest:views xmlns:forrest="http://apache.org/forrest/templates/1.0" >
  <forrest:view type="xhtml">
    <forrest:hook name="leftbar">
      <forrest:contract name="nav-section"/>
    </forrest:hook>
    <forrest:contract name="content-main"/>   
  </forrest:view>  
</forrest:views>]]>
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="cssView">
      <title>CSS in views</title>
      <p>
        We know now how to place contracts and hooks in our view, till this stage we only used the default.css. 
        CSS-support of views is as easy as placing contracts/hooks. To override the default.css
        stylesheet we use another tag within our view <code><![CDATA[<forrest:css url="default.css"/>]]></code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will now create a file in <code><![CDATA[{project:skins-dir}{path}/{name}.css]]></code>. In our case
        we will save a file called howTo.css in newSeed/src/documentation/skins/css/howTo.css containing only 
        the following css:
      </p>
      <source>/* menu */
#leftbar {
    width: 25%;
    float: left;
    background: #CCCCFF;
    border: thin solid #000000;
}
      </source>
      <p>
        We just changed the border-style to 'solid', the background to '#CCCCFF' and the color to '#000000'. 
        Now we have to add a new tag to tell that we want to override the default.css. We are doing this 
        by adding the tag <code><![CDATA[<forrest:css url="howTo.css"/>]]></code> to our view.
      </p>  
      <note>
        <code><![CDATA[<forrest:css url="howTo.css"/>]]></code> has to be direct son of 
        <code><![CDATA[<forrest:view type="xhtml">]]></code>!!!
      </note>
      <source><![CDATA[<forrest:views xmlns:forrest="http://apache.org/forrest/templates/1.0" >
  <forrest:view type="xhtml">
  	<forrest:css url="howTo.css"/>
    <forrest:hook name="leftbar">
      <forrest:contract name="nav-section"/>
    </forrest:hook>
    <forrest:contract name="content-main"/>   
  </forrest:view>  
</forrest:views>]]>
      </source>
      <p>
        Now you see a white page where the menu is sourrounded by a solid border with the defined background.
         As second example let us change as well the content-main by adding another hook 
         <code><![CDATA[<forrest:hook name="content"/>]]></code> We need to add the new layout container
         to our howTo.css:
      </p>
      <source>
/* The actual content */
#content {
    margin-left: 25%;
    padding: 0 20px 0 20px;
    background: #B9D3EE;
}
      </source>
      <p>
        Then we have to add the 'content-main' contract to the 'content' hook, the resulting view looks like:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[<forrest:views xmlns:forrest="http://apache.org/forrest/templates/1.0" >
  <forrest:view type="xhtml">
  	<forrest:css url="howTo.css"/>
    <forrest:hook name="leftbar">
      <forrest:contract name="nav-section"/>
    </forrest:hook>
    <forrest:hook name="content">
      <forrest:contract name="content-main"/>
    </forrest:hook>  
  </forrest:view>  
</forrest:views>]]>
      </source>
      <p>
        We are now able to place contracts into layout container and add custom css to the view.
      </p>

        Let us now look into advanced features of views. 
        I will write a how-to for advanced contracts soon. :)
