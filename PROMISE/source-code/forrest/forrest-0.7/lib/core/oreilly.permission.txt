Hi Dave,

Thanks for your mail and interest.

Yes, you have O'Reilly's permission (and the author's who
was happy to hear of your interest) to re-use some of the code
from XSLT Cookbook for the Forrest project.

It would be great if you would cite the usage by acknowledging
the original title/author with a standard credit line.

Thanks Dave.

Cindy
