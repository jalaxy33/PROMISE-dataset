    <title>Custom Schema</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <p>Forrest comes with a set of schemas for common documents, however, if you have existing documents
    that use a different schema you will want to tell Forrest how to work with them. The best way of doing
    this is to <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/0.7/docs/howto/howto-buildPlugin.html">build a plugin</a>
    so that you can easily reuse the functionality on different projects. Plugins also allow you to share
    this new functionality with other users, and to benefit from their contributions to your work.</p>
    
    <p>If you don't want to build a plugin you can make Forrest process them within your project sitemap 
    (but this won't really save you any work since the process is almost the same). This sample site has
    a demonstration of using a custom DTD. If you request <a href="custom.html">&lt;a href="custom.html"&gt;</a>
    you can see the results. Take a look at the project <code>sitemap.xmap</code> to see how it is done.</p>
    
    <note>Adding custom schemas with a plugin has the added benefit of being able to add the schema
    definition to the catalog file rather than having to reference it directly from within the XML
    document.</note>
