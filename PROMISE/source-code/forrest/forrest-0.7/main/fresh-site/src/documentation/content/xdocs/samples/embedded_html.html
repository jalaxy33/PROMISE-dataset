  <title>Embedded HTML demonstration page</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a name="intro" />Embedded HTML demonstration page</h1>
		
<p>An HTML document is used as the source for this page, and translated
to the intermediate Apache Forrest xdocs document structure. The sitemap then
does the normal aggregation with the navigation content and application of
the skin.
</p>

<p>
The html is being interpreted by Forrest and transformed to the
intermediate Apache xdocs document structure. That stylesheet cannot deal
with every possibility in unstructured html, so it tries to guess how to
build &lt;section&gt; elements and such.
It needs &lt;h1&gt; (&lt;h2&gt; etc.) headings in the source html
in order to identify sections. Patches are welcome to enhance
that transformer.
</p>

<p>
You can still take advantage of Forrest's
<a href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs/linking.html">"<b>site:<b>"
method of linking</a>, for example:
<a href="site:index">&lt;a href="site:index"&gt;</a>
</p>

<hr>
<note>XHTML can also be used, but it is just treated as interpreted
html. Future versions of Forrest will take much more advantage of XHTML.
</note>
<hr>

<h1><a name="examples" />Some example uses of HTML</h1>
<p>
There are situations when the Apache Forrest xdocs DTD is not sufficient.
The use of embedded HTML enables you to use HTML code in these situations.
</p>

<h2><a name="js" />Embedded applets and Javascript</h2>
      
<p>
See the
<a href="javascript:alert('Opened with Javascript via the body of the source html.')">Javascript alert pop-up</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="forms" />HTML forms for user interaction</h2>
<p>
Search the Forrest website via Google:
<!-- Search Google -->
<form target="_blank" action="http://www.google.com/search" method="get">
<input value="forrest.apache.org" name="as_sitesearch" type="hidden">
<input type=hidden name=ie value=UTF-8>
<input type=hidden name=oe value=UTF-8>
<a href="http://www.google.com/">
<img src="http://www.google.com/logos/Logo_40wht.gif" 
border="0" alt="Google Search" align="middle" width="150" height="55"></a>
<input type="text" name="as_q" size="25" maxlength="255" value="HTML">
&nbsp;
<input type="submit" name="btnG" value="Google Search">
</form>
<!-- Search Google -->

See a demonstration of "html" and "html forms" with our 
<a href="http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi">Forrest download mirror</a>
facility and the

<h2><a name="invalid" />Invalid HTML</h2>
<p>
This paragraph has a missing closing tag for the &lt;p&gt; element. If you look
at the <a href="embedded_html.xml">XML created by Forrest</a> you'll notice that 
Forrest has fixed this.

<h2>Potentially Invalid XDocs</h2>

<warning>However, it should also be noted that the resultant XML is not a valid document
since it contains the additional HTML elements. If you are intending to use
the intermediate XDocs for any purpose be aware of this fact.</warning>

<h2><a name="blink" />Other non-standard html-type abilities</h2>
<p>
Use other HTML <blink>delights (???) and tricks</blink>.
