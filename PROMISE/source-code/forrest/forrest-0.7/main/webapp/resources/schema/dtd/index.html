 <p>
  If you are here looking for the Apache Document DTDs
  then you shouldn't be :-)
  See <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs/catalog.html">Using Catalog Entity Resolver for local DTDs</a>.

 <p>
  That said, you can find the relevant DTDs using the naming convention
  "forrest.apache.org/dtd/document-v13.dtd" etc.
