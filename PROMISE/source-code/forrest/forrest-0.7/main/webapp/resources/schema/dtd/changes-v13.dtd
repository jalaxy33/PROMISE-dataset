     Apache Changes DTD (Version 1.2)

PURPOSE:
  This DTD was developed to create a simple yet powerful document
  type for software development changes for use with the Apache projects.
  It is an XML-compliant DTD and it's maintained by the Apache XML
  project.

TYPICAL INVOCATION:

  <!DOCTYPE document PUBLIC
       "-//APACHE//DTD Changes Vx.y//EN"
       "changes-vxy.dtd">

  where

    x := major version
    y := minor version

NOTES:
  It is important, expecially in open developped software projects, to keep
  track of software changes both to give users indications of bugs that might
  have been resolved, as well, and not less important, to provide credits
  for the support given to the project. It is considered vital to provide
  adequate payback using recognition and credits to let users and developers
  feel part of the community, thus increasing development power.
