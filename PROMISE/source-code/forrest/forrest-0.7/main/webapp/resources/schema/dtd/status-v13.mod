     Apache Status DTD (Version 1.3)

PURPOSE:
  This DTD was developed to be able to validate and guide the writing
  of the status.xml file. It merely includes the Changes DTD and Todo DTD,
  with some wrapper elements to cover the status.xml structure.

TYPICAL INVOCATION:

  <!DOCTYPE status PUBLIC
       "-//APACHE//DTD Status Vx.y//EN"
       "status-vxy.dtd">

  where

    x := major version
    y := minor version
