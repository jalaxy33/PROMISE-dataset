The relicense task is described at
http://issues.cocoondev.org/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=FOR-123

See ./relicense-tree.txt for listing of what sections have already been done
and the issues that remain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is one technique ...
* Do the whole tree, a section at a time, using insert_license.pl script.
* cd to a directory as high as you dare, e.g. src/documentation/
* In another window, do a practice run:
insert_license.pl -p /path/to/svn/forrest/src/documentation 2002-2004 > relicense.log
* Review the summary output and grep the relicence.log file.
* Investigate the files that are listed as having problems.
* When happy do a production run:
insert_license.pl /path/to/svn/forrest/src/documentation 2002-2004 > relicense.log
* Again review the summary output and grep the relicence.log file.
* Note any files that need fixing by hand
* Note sections that are finished and remaining issues in etc/relicense-tree.txt
* Do a 'svn diff' and make sure it is what you expected, then 'svn commit'.

* At some stage, use the Java or Python "relicense" script. This only deals
with the *.java files.

* Tweak the insert_license.pl script to address new issues.
