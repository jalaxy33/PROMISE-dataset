    <h2>Programming your own Selectors</h2>

    <h3>Selector Programming API</h3>

    <p>Want to define your own selectors? It's easy!</p>

    <p>First, pick the type of selector that you want to define. There
    are three types, and a recipe for each one follows. Chances are
    you'll want to work with the first one, Custom Selectors.</p>

    <h4>Custom Selectors</h4>

        <p>This is the category that Ant provides specifically for youto
        define your own Selectors. Anywhere you want to use your selector
        you use the <code>&lt;custom&gt;</code> element and specify
        the class name of your selector within it. See the
        <a href="selectors.html#customselect">Custom Selectors</a>
        section of the Selector page for details. The
        <code>&lt;custom&gt;</code> element can be used anywhere
        the core selectors can be used. It can be contained within
        <a href="selectors.html#selectcontainers">Selector Containers</a>,
        for example.</p>

        <p>To create a new Custom Selector, you have to create a class that
        implements
        <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.ExtendFileSelector</code>.
        The easiest way to do that is through the convenience base class
        <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseExtendSelector</code>,
        which provides all of the methods for supporting
        <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> tags. First, override the
        <code>isSelected()</code> method, and optionally the
        <code>verifySettings()</code> method. If your custom
        selector requires parameters to be set, you can also override
        the <code>setParameters()</code> method and interpret the
        parameters that are passed in any way you like. Several of the
        core selectors demonstrate how to do that because they can
        also be used as custom selectors.</p>

        <p><i>Note: If you don't need to set variables on your selector
        with the the embedded <code>&lt;param&gt;</code>
        elements, your custom selector could just implement the
        <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.FileSelector</code>
        interface rather than the full
        <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.ExtendFileSelector</code>
        interface. Using the latter will give you the most flexibility,
        though.</i></p>

        <p><i>Note: If you inherit from
        <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseExtendSelector</code>
        or
        <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelector</code>,
        any selector container will perform a validation pass before calling
        the <code>isSelected()</code> method. Make sure that all
        initialization is performed before the validation is done.</i></p>

      <h4>Core Selectors</h4>

        <p>These are the selectors used by Ant itself. To implement one of
        these, you will have to alter some of the classes contained within
        Ant.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>First, create a class that implements
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.FileSelector</code>.
            You can either choose to implement all methods yourself from
            scratch, or you can extend
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelector</code>
            instead, a convenience class that provides reasonable default
            behaviour for many methods.</p>

            <p>There is only one method required.
            <code>public boolean isSelected(File basedir, String filename,
              File file)</code>
              is the real purpose of the whole exercise. It returns true
              or false depending on whether the given file should be
              selected from the list or not.</p>

            <p>If you are using
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelector</code>
            there are also some predefined behaviours you can take advantage
            of. Any time you encounter a problem when setting attributes or
            adding tags, you can call setError(String errmsg) and the class
            will know that there is a problem. Then, at the top of your
            <code>isSelected()</code> method call <code>validate()</code> and
            a BuildException will be thrown with the contents of your error
            message. The <code>validate()</code> method also gives you a
            last change to check your settings for consistency because it
            calls <code>verifySettings()</code>. Override this method and
            call <code>setError()</code> within it if you detect any
            problems in how your selector is set up.</p>

            <p>You may also want to override <code>toString()</code>.</p>

          <li><p>Put an <code>add</code> method for your selector in
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.SelectorContainer</code>.
            This is an interface, so you will also have to add an implementation
            for the method in the classes which implement it, namely
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.AbstractFileSet</code> and
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelectorContainer</code>.
            Once it is in there, it will be available everywhere that core
            selectors are appropriate.</p>
        </ul>

      <h4>Selector Containers</h4>
        <p>Got an idea for a new Selector Container? Creating a new one is
        no problem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Create a new class that implements
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.SelectorContainer</code>.
            This will ensure that your new
            Container can access any new selectors that come along. Again, there
            is a convenience class available for you called
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelectorContainer</code>.
            </p>
          <li><p>Implement the
            <code>public boolean isSelected(String filename, File file)</code>
            method to do the right thing. Chances are you'll want to iterate
            over the selectors under you, so use
            <code>selectorElements()</code> to get an iterator that will do
            that.</p>
          <li><p>Again, put an <code>add</code> method for your container in
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.SelectorContainer</code>
            and its implementations
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.AbstractFileSet</code> and
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelectorContainer</code>.
            </p>
        </ul>
