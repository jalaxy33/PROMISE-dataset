/**
 * Export packages from the Visual Age for Java workspace.
 * The packages are specified similar to all other MatchingTasks.
 * Since the VA Workspace is not file based, this task is simulating
 * a directory hierarchy for the workspace:
 * The 'root' contains all project 'dir's, and the projects contain
 * their respective package 'dir's.
 * Example:
 * <blockquote>
 * &lt;vajexport destdir="C:/builddir/source">
 * &nbsp;&lt;include name="/MyVAProject/org/foo/subsystem1/**" />
 * &nbsp;&lt;exclude name="/MyVAProject/org/foo/subsystem1/test/**"/>
 * &lt;/vajexport>
 * </blockquote>
 * exports all packages in the project MyVAProject which start with
 * 'org.foo.subsystem1' except of these starting with
 * 'org.foo.subsystem1.test'.
 *
 * There are flags to choose which items to export:
 * exportSources:   export Java sources
 * exportResources: export project resources
 * exportClasses:   export class files
 * exportDebugInfo: export class files with debug info (use with exportClasses)
 * default is exporting Java files and resources.
