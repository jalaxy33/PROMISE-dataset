     * <BR>'*' which means zero or more characters,
     * <BR>'?' which means one and only one character.
     * <BR><BR>
     *  For example, if you want to check out all files except .XML and
     * .HTML files, you would put the following line in your program:
     * <CODE>setExcludes("*.XML,*.HTML");</CODE>
     * Finally, note that filters have no effect on the <B>directories</B>
     * that are scanned; you could not skip over all files in directories
     * whose names begin with "project," for instance.
     * <BR><BR>
     * Treatment of overlapping inlcudes and excludes: To give a simplistic
     * example suppose that you set your include filter to "*.htm *.html"
     * and your exclude filter to "index.*". What happens to index.html?
     * AntStarTeamCheckOut will not check out index.html, as it matches an
     * exclude filter ("index.*"), even though it matches the include
     * filter, as well.
