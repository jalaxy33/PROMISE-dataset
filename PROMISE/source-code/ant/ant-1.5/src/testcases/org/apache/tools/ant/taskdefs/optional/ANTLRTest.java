 * If you want to run tests, it is highly recommended
 * to download ANTLR (www.antlr.org), build the 'all' jar
 * with the mkalljar script and drop the jar (about 300KB) into
 * Ant lib.
 * - Running w/ the default antlr.jar (70KB) does not work (missing class)
 * - Running w/ the antlr jar made w/ mkjar (88KB) does not work (still another class missing)
 *
 * Unless of course you specify the ANTLR classpath in your
 * system classpath. (see ANTLR install.html)
