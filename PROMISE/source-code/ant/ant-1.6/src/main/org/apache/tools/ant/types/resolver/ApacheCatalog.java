/**
 * This class extends the Catalog class provided by Norman Walsh's
 * resolver library in xml-commons in order to add classpath entity
 * and URI resolution.  Since XMLCatalog already does classpath
 * resolution, we simply add all CatalogEntry instances back to the
 * controlling XMLCatalog instance.  This is done via a callback
 * mechanism.  ApacheCatalog is <em>only</em> used for external
 * catalog files.  Inline entries (currently <code>&lt;dtd&gt;</code>
 * and <code>&lt;entity&gt;</code>) are not added to ApacheCatalog.
 * See XMLCatalog.java for the details of the entity and URI
 * resolution algorithms.
