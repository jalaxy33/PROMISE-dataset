/**
 * <p>This class extends the CatalogResolver class provided by Norman
 * Walsh's resolver library in xml-commons.  It provides the bridge
 * between the Ant XMLCatalog datatype and the xml-commons Catalog
 * class.  XMLCatalog calls methods in this class using Reflection in
 * order to avoid requiring the xml-commons resolver library in the
 * path.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.apache.tools.ant.types.resolver.ApacheCatalog
 * ApacheCatalog} class is used to parse external catalog files, which
 * can be in either <a
 * href="http://oasis-open.org/committees/entity/background/9401.html">
 * plain text format</a> or <a
 * href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-06.html">
 * XML format</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>For each entry found in an external catalog file, if any, an
 * instance of {@link org.apache.tools.ant.types.ResourceLocation
 * ResourceLocation} is created and added to the controlling
 * XMLCatalog datatype.  In this way, these entries will be included
 * in XMLCatalog's lookup algorithm.  See XMLCatalog.java for more
 * details.</p>
