      What is a role
    </h3>
                        <p>
I am quoting here Jose Alberto Fernandez 26.04.2003 22:05:
Roles allow defining families of objects (members of a role) that can be
used by tasks or inner elements developed separately. 
The developer of the object accepting a particular role as a subelement
has no knowledge of the implementation of the object but much more
importantly it has no knowledge of the XML element tag used to refer
to this subelement in the XML file.
</p>
                                <p>

In the antlib proposal, there are two preset roles :
<ul>
					<li>task</li>
					<li>datatype</li>
				</ul>
Examples of other roles are :
<ul>
					<li>mapper</li>
					<li>filter</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
                                <p>
What does it all mean? It means we can now write a task, well typed, which 
can be accept different XML subelements depending on the declarations of 
other objects present on the build. The vendor specific elements of
&lt;ejbjar&gt;, &lt;jspc&gt; and others are typical examples of where this capability
can be very useful. Other parts of core could benefit of course.
</p>
                                <br />
                                      <h4 class="subsection">
        <a name="What do they do that is no possible in ANT"></a>
        What do they do that is no possible in ANT
      </h4>
                        <p>
They allow IntrospectionHelper to connect an XML subelement eventhough
introspection cannot find a create or add/Configured method for it.
It is a well typed methanism, the parent object will only be passed objects
that it knows how to deal with. And the parent object does not need to have 
any knowledge of what currently available members are on the role.
</p>
                                      <h3 class="section">
      <a name="roles versus DynamicConfigurator"></a>
      roles versus DynamicConfigurator
    </h3>
                        <p>
The closest thing in ANT today is DynamicConfigurator but its purpose
is on the other way around. Given an elementTag with no matching method
it is up to the parent object to try to make sense of it.
If we were to use this mechanism to accomplish what roles try to do, 
it would require the parent object implementor to be aware of where
to find the correct definition (remember it is a 3rd party implementation)
and perform the creation. It will be also its responsibility to
resolve type conflicts, name collisions, etc. This are all things
that should be done by IntrospectionHelper directly.
</p>
                                <p>

Also notice that Roles do not supersede DynamicConfigurator. On one hand roles
let external implementations to be considered as possible subelements
of a parent object, on the other hand, DynamicConfigurator allows a node
to decide given its current state what is the meaning of a particular element.
This cannot be done by roles in the general case, and that is good.
</p>

      Implementation of roles in the proposal
    </h3>
                        <p>this section quotes Jose Alberto Fernandez</p>
                                <p>
Here I may deviate from the exact code and add thoughts about where
do I think it should go.

        <a name="Usage of Roles"></a>
        Usage of Roles
      </h4>
                        <p>
The principle is very simple:
</p>
                                <br />
                                <ol>
							<li>
A role is defined by an interface. This interface is the parameter
   for a new special family of addConfigured(&lt;interface&gt;) methods.
</li>
							<li>
								<p>
When IntrospectionHelper fails to find a create/add method for the 
   element, it will look at all the roles used in the addConfigured 
   methods and on each of those roles will try to find an object declared 
   with that element-tag name. If one and only one match is found then
   the instantiation is successful and the new object will be configured;
   otherwise it is an error and parsing stops.
</p>
								<br />
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
 The configured object may or may not implement the Role interface,
   if it does not, an Adaptor object may be instantiated as a proxy 
   for the object. Which adaptor is used depends on how the implementation
   was declared.
</p>
								<br />
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
The resulting object is passed as an argument to the addConfigured() method.
</p>
								<br />
							</li>
						</ol>
                                                    <h4 class="subsection">
        <a name="Declaration of roles"></a>
        Declaration of roles
      </h4>
                        <p>
A role definition associates a name with an (Interface,Adaptor) pair.
The only reason for associating a name with the role is to ease notation when
declaring members of a role.
</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
Notice that the same interface or the same Adaptor may appear in multiple
declarations. This only means that depending on the name used the adaptor
of choice will be different.
</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>
There can only be one pair associated with each name.
</p>
                                <br />

        Declaration of implementations (members)
      </h4>
                        <br />
                                <p>
A class is declared as belonging to a role by specifying the name to be used
when appearing in that role. The same class may belong to multiple roles
and may specify the same or different names on each one.
<br />
						</p>
                                <p>
The name used for the role during the declaration only determines which
Adaptor will be available, if required. 
<br />
						</p>
                                <p>

Within a role-interface there can only be one object associated
with each name.
<br />
						</p>

                        <br />
                                <p>
This is probably the more dificult aspect since given the way
&lt;ant&gt; and &lt;antcall&gt; work it means possible redeclarations on every
level of recursion. Whether declarations should just supercede
one another or be smarter is something to look into.
<br />
						</p>

I have left out the issues of how the syntax looks like on purpose.
<br />
						</p>
                                <p>
Syntax is just that and I am sure we can reach agreement somehow.
It is also clear that we should provide tasks to define roles
and declare members of roles direclty on the build.

      Making ant aware of tag/role/class associations
    </h3>
                        <p>
The antlib proposal says :
Let's declare explicitly that a tag can be used in a particular role and is implemented by a specific class.
The declaration happens inside antlibs in the file META-INF/antlib.xml
</p>
                                <pre class="code">
  &lt;filter name=&quot;escapeunicode&quot; class=&quot;org.apache.tools.ant.filters.EscapeUnicode&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
                                <p>
CM says :
A normal typedef is enough to make ant aware of the existence of the class org.apache.tools.ant.filters.EscapeUnicode.
Due to the fact that EscapeUnicode implements ChainableReader, the association between EscapeUnicode and the filter role does not need to be stated explicitly.

The &lt;weblogic&gt; element in &lt;ejbjar&gt;, &lt;jspc&gt;, &lt;serverdeploy&gt;, has different meanings.

This is an argument to introduce roles in ant, and to associate an XML tag with a role and an implementation class.

The antlib proposal mentions adapter classes, which would be connected to roles.
Costin Manolache says that adapter classes should be tied to components, not roles.
The reason : two different components implementing the same interface (AKA role) can require different adapters.
