/**
 * An event "bus" providing a centralized place for posting
 * and recieving generic application events. To receive events a class must 
 * implement the "BusMember" interface. When registering as a member, an
 * "interrupt level" is provided, which specifies a relative ordering level
 * that the member wishes to receive events for. By convention, a member
 * can be registered at the MONITORING, VETOING, or RESPONDING levels, which
 * correspond to recieving events first to receiving events last. If a member
 * receives an event, the event is of type AntEvent, and the member calls the 
 * AntEvent.cancel() method, the event is not then delivered
 * to subsequent members. Members also indicate interest in an event
 * by providing an instance of the BusFilter interface.<BR>
 *
 * NB: This class is overly simple right now, but will eventually
 * be expanded to do better event filtering, interrupt levels, etc.
