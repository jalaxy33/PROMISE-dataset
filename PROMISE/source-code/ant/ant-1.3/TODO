TODO List:

  * Provide an AbstractFileCompareTask class with prebuilt "srcfile"
    and "destfile" setter methods and whose execute method calls a
    "updateNeeded" method.

  * Investigate some sort of command line "execute an instance of a
    task with these parameters" entry point. Maybe a
    `org.apache.ant.TaskMain task org.foo.BarTask attrib1=foo
    attrib2=bar` type entry point?

  * GUI front end -- examine tasks, add task properties, etc. Also,
    one button push build of a particular target.

  * Test harness. All software projects should have an automatable
    test suite. Ant is no exception to this rule.
