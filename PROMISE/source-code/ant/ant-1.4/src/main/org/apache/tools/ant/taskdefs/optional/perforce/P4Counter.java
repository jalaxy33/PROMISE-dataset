/** P4Counter - Obtain or set the value of a counter.
 * P4Counter can be used to either print the value of a counter
 * to the output stream for the project (by setting the "name"
 * attribute only), to set a property based on the value of
 * a counter (by setting the "property" attribute) or to set the counter
 * on the perforce server (by setting the "value" attribute). 
 *
 * Example Usage:<br>
 * &lt;p4counter name="${p4.counter}" property=${p4.change}"/&gt;
