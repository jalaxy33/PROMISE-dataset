<a href="http://www.jayasoft.org">Jayasoft</a> is pleased to announce the availability of Ivy version 1.3-RC1 and IvyDE 1.0 beta 1.

<a href="http://ivy.jayasoft.org">Ivy</a> is a free java based dependency manager, with powerful features such as transitive dependencies, ant integration, maven repository compatibility, continuous integration, html reports and many more.

As well as its strong dependency management engine, Ivy also benefits from a growing user community, a <a href="http://ivyrep.jayasoft.org/">public repository</a> of common ivy files, and from the source <a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/services">professional quality services</a>.

New and noteworthy features and improvements:
* a new default resolver which eases the use of ivy in common team environment with little or no configuration
* many improvements in the configuration area: macro resolvers, configuration file inclusion, resolver referencing, easy to define dual chain resolver, ...
* a set of features helping to build your own repository and managing heterogen repositories
* maven2 pom compatibility. Ivy is now able to use maven2 poms instead of its own metadata. This particularly helps leverage the public maven2 repository and help maven2 users do a smooth transition to Ivy.
* better flexibility of ivy files, including a better management of dependency exclusion, declaring module configurations in a separate file, and brand new defaultconfmapping and fallback conf mechanism
* and much more !

As usual, documentation has been updated to help use all those new features, and new tutorials are currently in preparation to be out with Ivy 1.3 release.

Furthermore, Ivy now has a companion for eclipse developers: IvyDE.
 
IvyDE is an open source eclipse plugin which brings the power of ivy to the eclipse developers.

This first version of the plugin includes all the features of the former closed source IvyEclipseUI, with a brand new ClasspathContainer, inspired by the work of Kevin o Neil on Necessitas, which leverages directly the power of Ivy in your IDE.

Thanks to Ivy module descriptor parser pluggability, IvyDE can also be used with maven poms, and any other plugged in module descriptor.

These features are fully configurable and have been currently tested with Eclipse 3.1.1.

Many thanks to the users feedbacks and contributions who made this possible.
