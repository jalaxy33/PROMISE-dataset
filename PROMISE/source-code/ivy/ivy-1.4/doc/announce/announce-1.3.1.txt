<a href="http://www.jayasoft.org">Jayasoft</a> is pleased to announce the availability of Ivy 1.3.1

<a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/ivy">Ivy</a> is a free java based dependency manager, with powerful features such as transitive dependencies, ant integration, maven repository compatibility, continuous integration, html reports and many more.

As well as its strong dependency management engine, Ivy also benefits from a growing user community, a <a href="http://ivyrep.jayasoft.org/">public repository</a> of common ivy files, and from the source <a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/services">professional quality services</a>.

This new release of Ivy is a bug fix release, which fixes particularly some bugs in the conflict management area. Upgrade from 1.3 is strongly recommended.

Many thanks to the users feedbacks and contributions who made this possible.
