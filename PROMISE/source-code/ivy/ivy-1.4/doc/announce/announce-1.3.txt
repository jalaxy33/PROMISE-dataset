<a href="http://www.jayasoft.org">Jayasoft</a> is pleased to announce the availability of Ivy 1.3 and IvyDE 1.0

<a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/ivy">Ivy</a> is a free java based dependency manager, with powerful features such as transitive dependencies, ant integration, maven repository compatibility, continuous integration, html reports and many more.

As well as its strong dependency management engine, Ivy also benefits from a growing user community, a <a href="http://ivyrep.jayasoft.org/">public repository</a> of common ivy files, and from the source <a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/services">professional quality services</a>.

This new release of Ivy is the same as the last release candidate (1.3-RC3), promoted to release status. 

Since the last release, many features, improvements and bug fixes have been added, including:
* a new default resolver which eases the use of ivy in common team environment with little or no configuration
* many improvements in the configuration area: macro resolvers, configuration file inclusion, resolver referencing, easy to define dual chain resolver, ...
* a set of features helping to build your own repository and managing heterogen repositories
* maven2 pom compatibility. Ivy is now able to use maven2 poms instead of its own metadata. This particularly helps leverage the public maven2 repository and help maven2 users do a smooth transition to Ivy.
* better flexibility of ivy files, including a better management of dependency exclusion, declaring module configurations in a separate file, and brand new defaultconfmapping and fallback conf mechanism
* and much more !


<a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/ivyde">IvyDE</a>, the open source eclipse plugin which brings the power of ivy to the eclipse developers, is now promoted to the status of release with this version 1.0.

IvyDE includes features such as ivy files syntax coloring, code completion, a classpath container which let you use directly ivy to build your eclipse classpath!

Many thanks to the users feedbacks and contributions who made this possible.
