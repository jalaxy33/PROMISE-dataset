/**
 * DualResolver is used to resolve dependencies with one dependency revolver, called ivy resolver,
 * and then download artifacts found in the resolved dependencies from a second dependency resolver,
 * called artifact resolver.
 * 
 * It is especially useful with resolvers using repository where there is a lot of artifact, but no
 * ivy file, like the maven ibiblio repository.
 * 
 * If no ivy file is found by the ivy resolver, the artifact resolver is used to check if there is
 * artifact corresponding to the request (with default ivy file).
 * 
 * For artifact download, however, only the artifact resolver is used.
 * 
 * Exactly two resolvers should be added to this resolver for it to work properly. The first resolver added
 * if the ivy resolver, the second is the artifact one.
