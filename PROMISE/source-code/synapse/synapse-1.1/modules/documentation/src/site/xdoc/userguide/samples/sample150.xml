                <p>
                    Introduce the concept of proxy services in Synapse
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Pre-requisites">
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService in the sample Axis2 server and start Axis2
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Start Synapse using the configuration numbered 150 (repository/conf/sample/synapse_sample_150.xml)
                            <div class="command">
                                Unix/Linux: sh synapse.sh -sample 150<br/>
                                Windows: synapse.bat -sample 150
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Executing the Client">
                <p>
                    Execute the stock quote client as follows and invoke the proxy service:
                </p>
                <div class="command">ant stockquote -Daddurl=http://localhost:8280/services/StockQuoteProxy</div>

                <p>
                    The 'inSequence' or 'endpoint' or both of these would decide how the message
                    would be handled after the proxy service receives the message. In the above
                    example, the request received is forwarded to the sample service hosted on Axis2.
                    The 'outSequence' defines how the response is handled before it is sent back to
                    the client. By default, a proxy service is exposed over all transportss
                    configured for Synapse, unless these are specifically mentioned through the
                    'transports' attribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also view the WSDL of the proxy service by launching a web browser and
                    navigating to the following URL:
                </p>
                <div class="command">http://localhost:8280/services/StockQuoteProxy?wsdl</div>
