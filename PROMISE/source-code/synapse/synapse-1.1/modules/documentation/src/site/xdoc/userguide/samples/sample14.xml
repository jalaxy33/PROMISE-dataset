			<subsection name="Pre-requisites">
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Start the Synapse configuration numbered 14: i.e. synapse
							-sample 14
						</li>
						<li>
							Start the Axis2 server and deploy the SimpleStockQuoteService if
							not already done
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

			<subsection name="Executing the Client">
				<p>
                    Execute the client as follows.
                </p>
                <div class="command">ant stockquote -Dtrpurl=http://localhost:8280/</div>
             	<p>This example shows sequences and endpoints fetched from local
				   registry. Thus it is possible to have endpoints sequences as
				   local registry entries including file entries.Execute the
				   following command to see the sample working, where you will be
				   able to see the log statement from the fetched sequence from the
				   local entry and the endpoint will be fetched from the specified
				   file at runtime and be cached in the system
