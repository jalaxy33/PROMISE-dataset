                        <li>

                        <li>
                            Start Synapse using the configuration numbered 6 (repository/conf/sample/synapse_sample_6.xml)

                                Unix/Linux: sh synapse.sh -sample 6<br/>

                        </li>

            <subsection name="Executing the Client">
                <p>
                    In this sample we wil run the client in dumb client mode (ie without addressing
                    information) as follows.
                </p>
                <div class="command">ant stockquote -Dtrpurl=http://localhost:8280/</div>
                <p>
                    The request is captured by the main sequence of Synapse and handed to the
                    in mediator. The header mediator sets the WS-Addressing 'To' header on the
                    request. Finally the send mediator sends the message to the EPR specified in
                    the addressing 'To' header.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Response coming back from Axis2 will also get dispatched to the main sequence.
                    But for the response the in mediator will not get executed. Only the send
                    mediator will operate on responses which will simply send them back to the
                    client.
