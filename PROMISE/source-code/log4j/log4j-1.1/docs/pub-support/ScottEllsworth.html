<BR></SPAN><SPAN class=EUDORAHEADER>Cc: cgu@qos.ch <BR></SPAN><BR>
<DIV>Hello.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I am quite excited that Java will be getting a logging facility in the near 
future.&nbsp; Such facilities have saved us countless hours of debug 
time.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Our development team started using log4j roughly six months ago, and we 
have become quite enamored with it.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>At <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A>, you 
will find a detailed summary of what one of the authors felt should change about 
jsr-47.&nbsp; I found his arguments compelling, but of those arguments, three 
are paramount.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>1.&nbsp; The ability to declare my hierarchies in any order.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Very often, I will want to turn logging on at a verbose level in 
org.metagraph.persistence.jdbc, off at org.metagraph.persistence, and on at info 
for org.metagraph.&nbsp; With log4j, I can do this in any order, as when I set a 
given level, it can walk up the tree.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>This is a wonderful feature, as it means that I can edit my config files 
without a lot of extra effort to make sure the order is right.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>2.&nbsp; The logging in log4j is faster if the statements are not 
evaluated.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>According to the analysis at the above web site, we will suffer a far 
larger penalty when not logging than we have to.&nbsp; As best my own perusal 
can tell, this is true.&nbsp; While this makes the penalty when logging a bit 
smaller, this is less important for my applications.&nbsp; Consider, a log 
message is likely to go to disk or network, thus there will already be 
substantial overhead.&nbsp; Adding the small amount for a runtime check is a 
minor matter.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Adding overhead when not logging is very, very bad.&nbsp; It means that 
more of our code will have logging removed at the source level.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>3.&nbsp; Make very, very sure that under NO circumstances will a runtime 
error or exception get propagated to the user.&nbsp; If my program behaves 
differently depending on what log level is active, I have just had my testing 
tasks increased immeasurably.&nbsp; The effect will be the removal of log 
statements by developers, and it is hard enough to get them to use 
them.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>On a separate note, we will not be able to move full time to jdk 1.4 for 
quite some time.&nbsp; By putting the logging kit in java.util, we cannot 
install a 1.3 version.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Were you to put it in javax, I could write 1.2 or 1.3 code that works 
happily without security exceptions.&nbsp; Please consider this move.</DIV><BR>
