class=EUDORAHEADER>Subject: JSR47 vs. log4j <BR></SPAN><SPAN 
class=EUDORAHEADER>To: java-logging-input@eng.sun.com <BR></SPAN><BR>
<DIV>To whom it may concern,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I feel that the differences between log4j and the JSR47 API outlined at 
the</DIV>
<DIV>following URL are significant.</DIV><BR>
<DIV><A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A></DIV><BR>
<DIV>I also feel, that rather than reinventing the wheel the JSR47 group 
should</DIV>
<DIV>incorporate the log4j API rather than recreating it.&nbsp; The standards 
put forth</DIV>
<DIV>by the JSR group will eventually replace any similarly functioning external 
API</DIV>
<DIV>due to its incorporation into the JDK.&nbsp; For the number of people who 
already</DIV>
<DIV>use log4j, such as myself, it feels that Sun by way of including this new 
API</DIV>
<DIV>in the JDK is forcing users of log4j to switch.&nbsp; I understand that 
there are</DIV>
<DIV>licensing issues but I suspect Ceki would be accommodating in this 
regard.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>In addition, by incorporating such projects into the API rather than 
recreating</DIV>
<DIV>them from scratch I believe Sun will promote more projects like these to 
move</DIV>
<DIV>forward rather than possibly dissuading programmers from creating new API's 
for</DIV>
<DIV>fear that their work will become useless by Sun's recreation of their 
features</DIV>
<DIV>in the next JDK.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I point to the success of Tomcat as an example.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Sincerely,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>-Ellis Teer</DIV><BR>
