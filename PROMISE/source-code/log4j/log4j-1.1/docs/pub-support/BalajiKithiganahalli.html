<DIV>Hi</DIV><BR><BR>
<DIV>At the outset I would like to say that this is a personal request and 
not</DIV>
<DIV>one from the company I work for. I don't represent the company at all 
in</DIV>
<DIV>this matter nor the company shares this view.</DIV><BR><BR>
<DIV>Sun seems to behave more and more like Microsoft by putting in more and 
more functionality in the java core programming language. On the whole this may 
help but most of the times this involves reinventing the wheel.</DIV>
<DIV>Sun has been consistent in criticizing Microsoft along with a host of 
others on the integration that they keep doing with their Windows OS starting 
with browsers and now with media players and personal firewalls in the upcoming 
version of Windows XP... One consequence of this integration is that other third 
party software companies often find themselves out of business - like Netscape 
for instance and a host of other small ones.</DIV>
<DIV>I would like Sun to stop reinventing the wheel and instead integrate 
the</DIV>
<DIV>logging API from log4j into jdk 1.4 that will make older software easier to 
integrate and show Sun's commitment to Open Source and differentiate Sun from 
Microsoft.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I also believe there are some fundamental flaws in the logging mechanism 
currently shipped with JDK 1.4. I believe that these are well summarised in the 
document</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;<A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A></DIV><BR>
<DIV>In particular, multiple debugging levels (FINE, FINER, FINEST) are 
very</DIV>
<DIV>difficult to separate in real terms.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Additionally, having looked through the source code of both Log4J and 
the</DIV>
<DIV>associated JSR 47 specification, I believe that more work and test 
hours</DIV>
<DIV>have gone into the Log4J rather than JSR specifications.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>As such, I believe that you should consider adopting the de-facto standard 
of Log4J as the logging utility in Java, rather than settle for second 
best.</DIV><BR><BR><BR>
<DIV>regards</DIV>
