class=EUDORAHEADER>Subject: Feedback: Java Logging in J2SDK 1.4 preview 
<BR></SPAN><SPAN class=EUDORAHEADER>User-Agent: Mutt/1.3.18i <BR></SPAN><BR>
<DIV>Dear Java grailkeepers,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I just checked out the public beta of J2SDK 1.4 that is available 
from</DIV>
<DIV>the Java Developer Connection. In my opinion 1.4 is a great step 
forward</DIV>
<DIV>in many areas (the I/O classes are the most important example), but I</DIV>
<DIV>also feel that the proposed logging facilities leave much to be 
desired.</DIV>
<DIV>In particular, they seem inferior to the popular log4j package which 
is</DIV>
<DIV>part of the Apache Jakarta project (<A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/</A>). Log4j</DIV>
<DIV>has been available for a couple of years now, it is free software, it</DIV>
<DIV>has proven to be well designed and well implemented, and it is 
already</DIV>
<DIV>used by many Java developers all over the world (including me) in 
many</DIV>
<DIV>projects with many different needs. Is it really necessary to come up</DIV>
<DIV>with a new API and a new implementation?</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thanks for your consideration, and thanks for your work. Java 
rocks!</DIV><BR>
