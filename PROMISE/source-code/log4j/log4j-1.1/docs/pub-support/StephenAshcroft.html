LOG4J vs. JSR47 <BR></SPAN><SPAN class=EUDORAHEADER>To:

<DIV>I got this mail address from the Apache LOG4J web-site and I understand 
</DIV>
<DIV>this is a forum where I can express some input regards the logging </DIV>
<DIV>mechanisms in the standard JDK. </DIV><BR>
<DIV>We have a large investment in LOG4J, it is the standard API used in all 
</DIV>
<DIV>of our java projects and we have been increasing users of it for over 1 
</DIV>
<DIV>year. It is simple, reliable and very configurable - key features for 
</DIV>
<DIV>us. It was chosen after an extensive review of the other available </DIV>
<DIV>logging packages, including a fairly complex in-house development. </DIV>
<DIV>Moving to anything else would be a significant task which we would be 
</DIV>
<DIV>reluctant to undertake without a compelling reason. </DIV><BR>
<DIV>About the only reason that would cause us to change would be the </DIV>
<DIV>inclusion of a standard logging API in the JDK as we aim to be </DIV>
<DIV>standards conformant wherever practicable. However, the proposed JSR47 
</DIV>
<DIV>logging standard for JDK 1.4 falls far short of our expectations and </DIV>
<DIV>would be a major step backwards for us. I won't re-hash the issues as 
</DIV>
<DIV>these have been extensively documented on the log4j web site.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>We are unlikely to adopt JSR47 for our use as it stands, and I suspect 
</DIV>
<DIV>we are typical of a large number of existing users. LOG4J has evolved 
</DIV>
<DIV>tremendously from its first incarnation due to feedback from people who 
</DIV>
<DIV>actually use it, to the point where it is now a mature product which </DIV>
<DIV>*works today*. </DIV><BR>
<DIV>I once attended a talk by Gosling who stated that one of the </DIV>
<DIV>fundamental principles that was adopted in developing the Java API was 
</DIV>
<DIV>that it was better to leave a feature out than to include one that was 
</DIV>
<DIV>only half-ready, as adding features later to fill a gap was much easier 
</DIV>
<DIV>than fixing something that was broken but already in use.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Logging is probably one of the hardest areas to standardise, as almost 
</DIV>
<DIV>everyone can easily develop a simple logging API and there are probably 
</DIV>
<DIV>thousands of different home-grown APIs in use. I would urgently suggest 
</DIV>
<DIV>to SUN that they either adopt LOG4J as the standard logging package, or 
</DIV>
<DIV>pull logging out of the JDK1.4 (merlin) release entirely and work </DIV>
<DIV>through the concerns that clearly exist before making any decision on 
</DIV>
<DIV>standardisation.</DIV><BR>
