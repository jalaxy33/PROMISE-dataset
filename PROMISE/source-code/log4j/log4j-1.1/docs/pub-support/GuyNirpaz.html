<DIV>Hello,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I would like to express my concerns with the new logging API.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Logging is fundamental in every software system. Therefore, when the</DIV>
<DIV>Java platform introduces its own logging API, it should be as good as</DIV>
<DIV>possible.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>My biggest concern is that once an immature logging API is out, it 
might</DIV>
<DIV>weaken the Java platform ,due to its huge influence.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>For the last four years, I have been implementing with Java large</DIV>
<DIV>enterprise systems (e.g. trading, SCM, e-commerce). Two years ago, I</DIV>
<DIV>adopted the Log4J logging API (currently under the Apache umbrella,</DIV>
<DIV>formerly by IBM). I believe that this API is by far much more mature</DIV>
<DIV>than the proposed API. I think that the Java logging API should adopt</DIV>
<DIV>the concepts that are implemented in Log4J.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>The biggest flaws of the proposed API, and which are better 
implemented</DIV>
<DIV>in Log4J are:</DIV><BR>
<DIV>1. Lack of generality - Log4J can be used in all Java environments,</DIV>
<DIV>including application servers (EJB's), servlets, and custom</DIV>
<DIV>applications, and is compatible with JDK 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3. </DIV>
<DIV>2. Limited flexibility - the configuration process in Log4J is plain 
and</DIV>
<DIV>simple (both properties and XML), and allows you to alter almost 
every</DIV>
<DIV>aspect of logging, in any order.</DIV>
<DIV>3. Limited extendibility - one can get all his logging needs by</DIV>
<DIV>assembling and extending existing log elements.</DIV>
<DIV>4. Poor error handling - log never fails your application (no</DIV>
<DIV>RuntimeException).</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I ask you to reconsider publishing the API at its current stage. You</DIV>
<DIV>might consider using Log4J instead, or if you'd like, implement the</DIV>
<DIV>important concepts that are in Log4J.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Respectfully yours,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Guy Nirpaz</DIV>
