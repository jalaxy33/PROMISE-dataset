<DIV>Graham,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thank you for your reply.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>&gt; </DIV>
<DIV>&gt; Unfortunately we are quite late in the Merlin cycle and</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; we can't really accommodate major API changes at this point.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I don't consider that a valid excuse for rushing out an api which isn't 
as</DIV>
<DIV>good as it could be.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>&gt; However, I will be studying Ceki's comments carefully.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt;</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I am pleased that you will look at the comments, and I hope that action 
to</DIV>
<DIV>improve the logging api for JDK 1.4 will result. Even if that means delay 
in</DIV>
<DIV>the process.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Regards,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Emily Bache</DIV>
