<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN class=324163011-13062001>I would like to say

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN class=324163011-13062001>I found the 
presences of logging levels like FINE, FINEST to be quite meaningless across an 
entire API; but possibly meaningful withing a single company (a small company), 
however a much better alternative is to just have that company define their own 
logging levels. I was hoping that JSR47 would draw a line in the Java sands, and 
say: From now on you can integrate logging of 3rd party products into your own 
logging systems, but if 3rdparty products actually use FINE / FINEST, etc, they 
are highly likely to view the meaning as being different; so how can I now 
integrate ?</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN class=324163011-13062001>I'm also somewhat 
disturbed by the way in which JSR47 lacks an SPI. I've quite liked the way in 
which other areas of software have been commoditized by Javasoft; I felt that 
was very statesmans-like, it's also generates so-called best-of-breed 
implementations. JSR47 however does not commoditize the market, but actually 
punishes the best logging product for Java there is: log4j, this is, in my 
opinion, a foolish step to make. You may find that not everyone will appreciate 
the reduced functionality that JSR47 offers and stick with log4j. Had you 
provided JSR47 with an SPI then it would not have been long before log4j would 
have implemented the SPI; and bingo! JSR47 would have gathered support 
immediately (much like JAXP has). It's a pity that the main factor in creating 
JSR47 has been the Not Invented Here syndrome.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN class=324163011-13062001>In summary: I think 
that Log4J should be made the standard logging API for Java, and not 
JSR47.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>
