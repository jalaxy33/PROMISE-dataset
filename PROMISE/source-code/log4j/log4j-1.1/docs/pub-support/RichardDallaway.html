<DIV>I think it's great that logging has been recognized as being important 
enough to include in the JDK.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I have no strong technical views telling me if JSR47 is preferable to 
log4j, although from a casual glance log4j looks both more mature and more 
feature rich.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>My concern is perhaps more general in the way that the JCP is working (or 
not working) with established projects.&nbsp; The three projects that come to 
mind are:</DIV>
<DIV>1.&nbsp; log4j v. JSR47</DIV>
<DIV>2.&nbsp; Apache struts v. JavaServer Faces</DIV>
<DIV>3.&nbsp; Apache Xalan/Xerces v. JAX.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>There may be very good reasons why Sun is spending effort on building 
projects that already have tried and tested counterparts.&nbsp; Maybe there are 
things missing from other projects, maybe Sun can do a better job, maybe it's a 
licensing thing, maybe the project code quality isn't high enough.&nbsp; I don't 
know, but it would be refreshing to get a statement giving a clear 
indication.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>The big worry is that there's some fundamental issue with the community 
process that's preventing collaboration.&nbsp; I'd appreciate some clarification 
on this.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Regards</DIV>
