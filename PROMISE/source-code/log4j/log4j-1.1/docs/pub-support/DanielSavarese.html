<DIV>&gt;&gt;I also feel, that rather than reinventing the wheel the JSR47 group 
should</DIV>
<DIV>&gt;&gt;incorporate the log4j API rather than recreating it.&nbsp; The 
standards put forth</DIV>
<DIV>&gt;&gt;by the JSR group will eventually replace any similarly functioning 
external A</DIV>
<DIV>&gt;PI</DIV>
<DIV>&gt;&gt;due to its incorporation into the JDK.&nbsp; For the number of 
people who already</DIV>
<DIV>&gt;&gt;use log4j, such as myself, it feels that Sun by way of including 
this new API</DIV>
<DIV>&gt;&gt;in the JDK is forcing users of log4j to switch.&nbsp; I understand 
that there are</DIV><BR>
<DIV>This is just business as usual at Sun.&nbsp; The position may sound 
extreme,</DIV>
<DIV>but the continued marginalization of third party Java solutions is</DIV>
<DIV>destructive to the Java development community.&nbsp; It could almost 
be</DIV>
<DIV>justified if the stuff that made its way into the core or a standard</DIV>
<DIV>was actually better than what was already out there, but most of the</DIV>
<DIV>time it's not and blatantly ignores the lessons learned by those who</DIV>
<DIV>have studied the problem for far longer and had the benefit of many</DIV>
<DIV>years of deployment and user feedback.&nbsp; A one year JSR working 
group</DIV>
<DIV>operating in a vacuum generally produces results that are inferior to 
a</DIV>
<DIV>solution with 4+ years of evolution.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Disclaimer: These are general comments that I do not intend to 
specifically</DIV>
<DIV>apply to JSR-47.&nbsp; I have not reviewed JSR-47 or compared it to log4j, 
so</DIV>
<DIV>I cannot comment on its quality.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the fact that none of 
the</DIV>
<DIV>developers of the most popular Java logging API were invited to serve 
as</DIV>
<DIV>a working group expert is a gross oversight.&nbsp; I can say the same 
thing</DIV>
<DIV>about several other JSRs.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I hate to be such a complainer, but it really makes you feel 
helpless.</DIV>
<DIV>The only recourse we have is to constantly poll the JCP site and 
provide</DIV>
<DIV>as much feedback as possible when a JSR draft is released, which is 
usually</DIV>
<DIV>too late to make any significant changes.&nbsp; Here's an article providing 
a</DIV>
<DIV>general criticism about the Java Community Process:</DIV>
