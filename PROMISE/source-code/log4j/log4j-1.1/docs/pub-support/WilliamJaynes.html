<DIV>To whom it may concern,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I urge the JSR group to consider adopting the log4j API rather than 
the</DIV>
<DIV>JSR47 proposal.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Log4j has been developed over a period of years by a large number of</DIV>
<DIV>experienced developers who use it themselves. It is a product of the</DIV>
<DIV>best practices of the opensource tradition, forged in the fire of 
public</DIV>
<DIV>scrutiny, public debate, public development, public contributions, 
and</DIV>
<DIV>mass public testing. The quality and thoroughness that comes from such 
a</DIV>
<DIV>process can not be approached by any committee, no matter how 
brilliant</DIV>
<DIV>or experienced the committee members may be.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I believe that Sun should defer to Log4j, for the same good reasons 
that</DIV>
<DIV>it deferred to Tomcat.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Respectfully,</DIV><BR>
