<DIV>I am happily awaiting jdk1.4's release for many reasons. Finally 
being</DIV>
<DIV>able to use the equivalent of mmap and poll excite me. The new work 
in</DIV>
<DIV>Swing is looking very promising.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>But, honestly, I am worried about the direction logging is 
taking.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Having used log4j in several large websites,</DIV>
<DIV>(<A href="http://www.tradingroom.com.au being a prime example/" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://www.tradingroom.com.au being a prime example</A>), I 
love</DIV>
<DIV>log4j. It works for my group of coders very well. </DIV><BR>
<DIV>I was looking forward to the adoption of a standard logging standard,</DIV>
<DIV>but various problems with it make me less willing to use the 
standard,</DIV>
<DIV>and stay with the tried and true solution. </DIV><BR>
<DIV>For example, having runtime behavior dependant on&nbsp; configuration</DIV>
<DIV>ordering, scares the crap out of me. I know most of our junior coders</DIV>
<DIV>believe, on a metaphysical level, that configuration files can be cut</DIV>
<DIV>and pasted to their hearts content. If this cut'n'paste</DIV>
<DIV>methodology introduces subtle bugs, then I will never see the end of 
the</DIV>
<DIV>wasted debugging effort.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>The multitude of logging levels looks, honestly, like something</DIV>
<DIV>designed by an academic or a committee. When was the last time these</DIV>
<DIV>guys actually stepped out and coded something? Something large?</DIV>
<DIV>Something with a team of 20 coders? Something with a fair percentage</DIV>
<DIV>of recent uni graduates involved?</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Log4j is a well respected, widely used, and robust, logging API. The</DIV>
<DIV>industry is already using it. </DIV><BR>
<DIV>Adopt it. Please don't divide the community.</DIV><BR>
