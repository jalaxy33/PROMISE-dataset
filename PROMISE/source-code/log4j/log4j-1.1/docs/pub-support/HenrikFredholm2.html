<DIV>Dear Graham</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thanks for your response. I understand that if other parts of JKD 1.4 is 
</DIV>
<DIV>using the logging api it will be difficult to make changes. However 
it</DIV>
<DIV>is not clear to me that the JSR-047 has recieved the same attention as 
</DIV>
<DIV>for instance the Java collection framework did, where the Java community 
</DIV>
<DIV>recieved beta implementations and the FAQ list gave very good reasons 
for</DIV>
<DIV>the design and its deviations from existing collection libraries. 
</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Regards </DIV>
<DIV>Henrik</DIV><BR>

<DIV>Henrik,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thanks for your interest in the logging APIs.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>As Ceki noted, IBM has been a very active participant in the</DIV>
<DIV>JSR-047 logging JSR.&nbsp; When the logging JSR was initiated in</DIV>
<DIV>January 2000, IBM had both the log4j work at IBM research and</DIV>
<DIV>the JLog work at IBM Tivoli.&nbsp; The Tivoli work built on IBM's</DIV>
<DIV>earlier product logging experience and included features like</DIV>
<DIV>internationalization that were then not present in log4j.</DIV>
<DIV>IBM's involvement in JSR-047 was focused on their JLog</DIV>
<DIV>experience which had seen a lot of use in IBM products.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>However, Ceki also provided useful input from log4j, and that</DIV>
<DIV>has influenced some parts of the logging APIs.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>In designing the APIs we've tried to draw from numerous</DIV>
<DIV>sources and we've tried to support a wide set of requirements.</DIV>
<DIV>It's inevitable that when there is a new standardization</DIV>
<DIV>effort it will make some different choices from some of</DIV>
<DIV>the existing APIs.&nbsp; We went through a similar experience</DIV>
<DIV>with JDBC.&nbsp; It built on a bunch of earlier work, but it</DIV>
<DIV>wasn't exactly like any of them.&nbsp; Unfortunately we delayed</DIV>
<DIV>adding a JDK logging API for too long, and I think it</DIV>
<DIV>is important that we resolve that in Merlin.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Unfortunately we are quite late in the Merlin cycle and</DIV>
<DIV>we can't really accommodate major API changes at this point.</DIV>
<DIV>However, I will be studying Ceki's comments carefully.</DIV><BR>

<DIV>&gt; Hi,</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; </DIV>
<DIV>&gt; Could you please adopt log4j as the logging API shiped with JDK 1.4. 
This</DIV>
<DIV>is</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; an excelent API that I feel is superior to JSR47 and addresses the 
needs</DIV>
<DIV>we</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; have for loging. It even works with existing JDKs. We have adopted it 
as</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; standard for all J2EE BEA WebLogic based projects in our 
organization.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; </DIV>
