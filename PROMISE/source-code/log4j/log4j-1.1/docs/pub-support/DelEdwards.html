<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using Log4j a few months ago, I was "surprised" 
that to see that</DIV>
<DIV>JSR47 was a request to "duplicate" functionality that already existed 
in</DIV>
<DIV>Log4j. After reading the recent comparison of the two&nbsp; logging APIs ( 
at "</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html"

<DIV>&lt;<A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A>&gt; " ) 
I must say it seems</DIV>
<DIV>"silly" not to adopt Log4j as the logging API that ships with jkd1.4 
(as</DIV>
<DIV>well as with existing compatible jdks !).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think its great seeing the JSR process in action. I 
think it does</DIV>
<DIV>wonders for the language. It would be disappointing, however, to see such 
a</DIV>
<DIV>useless waste of time as JSR47's re-implementation of an existing 
logging</DIV>
<DIV>API - that will result in an "official" API that is untested,</DIV>
<DIV>yet-to-be-accepted, has less functionality and is harder to use.</DIV>
