<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear sir,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Please do consider using Log4J as the standard Java 
logging package.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>- It has been around for several years, and is 
certainly more mature than the package you are trying to produce.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>- Doing a new logging package is nonsense : why 
reinvent the wheel? Does your manager have pointy hair?</FONT> <BR><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>- Log4J is already widely used by companies around the 
globe.</FONT> <BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>- Log4J is a lot more powerful than 
what you intend to make. In my current projects, there are two particular issues 
that log4j resolves, and that your software doesn't :</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT face=Arial size=2>- 
Configuration via XML (and not just with a Property file)</FONT>
