<DIV>After reviewing the available logging kits, I've been in the process of 
converting our system from a proprietary logging API to use the log4j toolkit 
(<A href="http://www.log4j.org/" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://www.log4j.org</A>).&nbsp; While I was pleased to see a 
logging implementation included in the JDK 1.4 plans, I was very disappointed to 
see that it was not log4j.&nbsp; Clearly it is the most widely recognized and 
currently used implementation available today.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Apache, Enhydra, JBoss, Expresso, FreeHEP, and countless others, all 
selected log4j for a reason.&nbsp; It is the only serious solution for a logging 
API.&nbsp; On technical merit alone, clearly there is no comparison. I certainly 
hope that IBM's toolkit is not being selected for political reasons only.&nbsp; 
I strongly urge you to reconsider the logging implementation for JDK 
1.4.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thank you for listening to the concerns of the development 
community.</DIV><BR>
