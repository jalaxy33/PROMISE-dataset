<DIV>Subject: Re: Log4J Vote</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Jon,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thanks for your interest in the logging APIs.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>As Ceki noted, IBM has been a very active participant in the</DIV>
<DIV>JSR-047 logging JSR.&nbsp; When the logging JSR was initiated in</DIV>
<DIV>January 2000, IBM had both the log4j work at IBM research and</DIV>
<DIV>the JLog work at IBM Tivoli.&nbsp; The Tivoli work built on IBM's</DIV>
<DIV>earlier product logging experience and included features like</DIV>
<DIV>internationalization that were then not present in log4j.</DIV>
<DIV>IBM's involvement in JSR-047 was focused on their JLog</DIV>
<DIV>experience which had seen a lot of use in IBM products.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>However, Ceki also provided useful input from log4j, and that</DIV>
<DIV>has influenced some parts of the logging APIs.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>In designing the APIs we've tried to draw from numerous</DIV>
<DIV>sources and we've tried to support a wide set of requirements.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>It's inevitable that when there is a new standardization</DIV>
<DIV>effort it will make some different choices from some of</DIV>
<DIV>the existing APIs.&nbsp; We went through a similar experience</DIV>
<DIV>with JDBC.&nbsp; It build on a bunch of earlier work, but it</DIV>
<DIV>wasn't exactly like any of them.&nbsp; Unfortunately we delayed</DIV>
<DIV>adding a JDK logging API for too long, and I think it</DIV>
<DIV>is important that we resolve that in Merlin.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Unfortunately we are quite late in the Merlin cycle and</DIV>
<DIV>we can't really accommodate major API changes at this point.</DIV>
<DIV>However, I will be studying Ceki's comments carefully.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
thanks</DIV>
