<DIV>I'm writing to express disappointment with the outcome of the JCP in </DIV>
<DIV>the area of logging API.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I'm working as technical architect on one of the largest retail web </DIV>
<DIV>sites in the UK, and after lengthy study we're moving all client and </DIV>
<DIV>server software to log4J.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I had thought it might be a stopgap until the 'official' API appeared. 
</DIV>
<DIV>Now I see it will be permanent. An opportunity has been missed here to 
'</DIV>
<DIV>blass' what is clearly the superior framework and I strongly urge </DIV>
<DIV>reconsideration of the direction the JCP is taking and the adoption of 
</DIV>
<DIV>log4J.</DIV><BR>
