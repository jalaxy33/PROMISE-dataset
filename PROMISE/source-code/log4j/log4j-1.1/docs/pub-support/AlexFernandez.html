Hyerarchy in JSR47 <BR></SPAN><BR>
<DIV>Hi folks!</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Browsing over the logging mechanism in JDK 1.4, I found to my 
surprise</DIV>
<DIV>that logger hyerarchy is reversed: parents know about children, but</DIV>
<DIV>children do not have access to their parents.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>This is the exact reverse of what class hyerarchies have done since</DIV>
<DIV>Modula-2. It seems illogical: children loggers must know what logger</DIV>
<DIV>they come from, and parents do not need to access to children</DIV>
<DIV>information.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>This point is well done in log4j, and so it would seem practical to</DIV>
<DIV>adopt it as a standard. log4j has worked like a charm for us in our</DIV>
<DIV>project, and its license is very convenient. So I take the liberty to</DIV>
<DIV>suggest using it as a standard logging mechanism; or at least specify 
a</DIV>
<DIV>set of interfaces based on it, so that 3rd parties (including log4j's</DIV>
<DIV>creator) can build and ship their own implementation, a la J2EE.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thanks for your attention,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Alex Fernández.</DIV>
