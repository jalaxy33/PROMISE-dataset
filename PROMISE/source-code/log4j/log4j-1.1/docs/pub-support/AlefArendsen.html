<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>after reviewing a lot of logging APIs and doing some 
own implementations we found out (a couple of months ago) that Log4J was by far 
the best logging API out there. Not ony because of its perfect extendability, 
but also because of its high performance (we couldn't do it any better) and the 
possibility to keeps things very basic if needed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now that Sun is implementing its own logging API I 
foresee big problems when people start to use both at the same time. Logging 
output from software from one vendor and our own will kind of clash. This 
especially when implementing and integrating component based software in for 
instance a J2EE environment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>What I would greatly appreciate if the future logging 
API Sun is going to offer at least stays somehow compatible with the Log4J API. 
Maybe it could be possible to plug in your own logging engine or something like 
that. This probably won't be possible if the API differ in such fundamental 
issues like the priorities (JSR47: ALL, SEVER, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, 
FINER, FINEST and OFF, versus Log4J: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) and the 
inheritance of categories and other things like that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Furthermore it would be very handy if any logging API 
stays backward compatible with older Java version (at least 1.2, since lots of 
enterprise systems simply aren't ready yet for Java 1.4).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I would greatly appreciate any kind of reaction on 
all this.</FONT> </P>
