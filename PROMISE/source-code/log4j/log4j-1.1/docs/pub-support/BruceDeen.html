<DIV>I would like to put my request in to make log4j the logging api to be 
shipped with jdk1.4 (merlin).&nbsp; I'm a consultant that does mostly java/j2ee 
consulting with large companies and I've come to depend upon log4j as a logging 
tool for all my applications.&nbsp; Once the jdk is shipped with a default 
logging api I'm afraid that most customers will automatically believe that this 
is a superior api, although I haven't been able to use the jdk1.4 logging api 
yet, since it is only in beta release I can't completely compare it against 
log4j so I must depend upon others to help educate me about it's merits or lack 
there of.&nbsp; So this is my polite request to make log4j the default for 
jdk1.4.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>thank you</DIV>
