<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dear Sun,</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I'm very pleased to see that JDK1.4 is going to have 
a logging API associated with it.&nbsp; And in particular I think the JSR47 
specification has some good ideas behind it.&nbsp; However, I'm concerned that, 
in its current form, it contains some shortcomings that will affect its 
usability and performance.&nbsp; Namely, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1.&nbsp; Performance -- It seems that setting the log 
level of the root logger in JSR47 recursively sets the log level of all 
descendant loggers.&nbsp; The projects I've worked on tended to have trees with 
a large depth to them, which would result in a performance hit under this 
scheme.&nbsp; Allowing descendant loggers to determine their log level as needed 
would seem to be more performant.</FONT></P><BR>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2.&nbsp; Usability -- There are a number of areas I'm 
concerned about in terms of usability.&nbsp; The following lists the major 
ones:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Error Handling -- I believe a logging facility should 
be as unobtrusive as possible.&nbsp; In its current form, it looks like JSR47 
requires programmers to explicitly catch potential runtime exceptions to avoid a 
program crash.&nbsp; In my experience, it's been more useful to have a logging 
package mostly suppress errors (perhaps, at minimum, reporting an error to a 
standard location like stdout/stderr), rather than having to code around error 
handlers.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Setting of Log Levels -- I'm a little concerned about 
the fact that setting a parent logger's log level will overwrite all of its 
children's log levels.&nbsp; I'm not convinced that it will always be convenient 
to first set a parent logger's level prior to setting a child's log level.&nbsp; 
But in the JSR47 scheme, if you don't set the log levels in the correct order, 
you will unintentionally overwrite a child's log level.&nbsp; I'm afraid that 
this will at minimum cause confusion, and at worst be intractable in some cases. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Inheriting Parent Handlers -- It doesn't seem like 
this is explicitly possible in JSR47.&nbsp; Global handlers provide some of this 
functionality, but they are not as flexible as the idea of true handler 
inheritance.&nbsp; The same limitation exists for resource bundles.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Supporting Multiple Concurrent Handlers -- It doesn't 
seem that you can have a logger write to more than one handler at a time.&nbsp; 
This capability can be&nbsp; extremely useful at times; for example, in tech 
support cases, it's nice to be able to add a socket as a log recipient, in 
addition to the usual log file.</FONT></P><BR>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>There are some other areas where I believe 
improvements could be made, such as log entry formatting, and a more extensive 
list of log handlers, but the preceding are the ones that really concern 
me.&nbsp; </FONT></P><BR>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Currently there exists another java logging package 
called log4j, available from <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org" 
target=_blank>http://jakarta.apache.org</A>, that addresses these items.&nbsp; 
I've been using it on various projects, and have been extremely impressed with 
its robustness, flexibility, and ease of use.&nbsp; I'm certainly not your 
stereotypical die hard fanatic that, once familiar with a software package, will 
never sway from it or try anything new.&nbsp; In fact, I'm eager to learn and 
become proficient with any Java standard API's that come out.&nbsp; However, the 
issues I mentioned above are, I'm afraid, too weighty to allow me to use the 
current form of the JSR47 specification in place of the package I've been 
using.&nbsp; I hope that you'll take these comments into consideration and 
either adopt log4j as the logging API for JDK1.4, or at least revise the current 
specification to handle the above listed items.</FONT></P><BR><BR>
