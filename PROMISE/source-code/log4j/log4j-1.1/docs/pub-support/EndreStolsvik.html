<BR></SPAN><SPAN class=EUDORAHEADER>X-Virus-Scanned: by AMaViS perl-10 
<BR></SPAN><BR>
<DIV>There has been lots of critique on the logging API being defined by</DIV>
<DIV>the JSR47 expert group.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Log4j is a Open Source logging package that has been around for 
several</DIV>
<DIV>years and have had _lots_ of time to develop. It quite recently became 
an</DIV>
<DIV>Apache project, and has after this gotten even more downloads, usage 
and</DIV>
<DIV>hence improvements.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I urge the expert group to at least take into serious consideration 
all</DIV>
<DIV>the inputs it has gotten from various projects, while the standard 
still</DIV>
<DIV>is in the "public-review stage".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; Ceki Gülcü is the "main man" for the log4j project, and have written 
a</DIV>
<DIV>condensed "report" of what he feels is the "worst" design choices 
that</DIV>
<DIV>have been done in the JSR47.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; Read:&nbsp; <A 
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A></DIV><BR>
<DIV>I cannot understand why the JSR47 cannot _base_ their work on this 
_widely</DIV>
<DIV>used_ logging package that's already been out in the fields for 
years.</DIV>
<DIV>Several other logging packages' teams have complained about the 
JSR47's</DIV>
<DIV>API. If Sun actually mean that their JSR process is _somewhat_ open, 
it</DIV>
<DIV>would be rather idiotic to not take all this feedback into 
consideration.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thank you for your time.</DIV><BR>
