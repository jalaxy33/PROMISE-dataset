<DIV>Hi,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>As have many others already suggested,</DIV>
<DIV>I think the LOG4J logging API has far more to offer than</DIV>
<DIV>the newly proposed logging api included in the upcoming JDK1.4 
release,</DIV>
<DIV>(JSR 47 specification).</DIV><BR>
<DIV>It is only since a couple of weeks I started using log4j and already 
has</DIV>
<DIV>it made our project much more stable and clearer.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>One of the main goals is software-reuse, why not simply use what is 
out</DIV>
<DIV>there, since a couple of years, tested against various factors: such 
as</DIV>
<DIV>performance, extensibility, .... .</DIV>
<DIV>Not that it is perfect yet but I believe superior than what has been</DIV>
<DIV>proposed through JSR 47.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>In my opinion one should choose second to NONE, consider adopting the</DIV>
<DIV>LOG4J standard rather than choosing the best to ONE.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Having the JSR47 included and afterwards changed and extended to another 
or</DIV>
<DIV>not use the JSR47 at all will be inevitable in the future, I 
think.</DIV><BR>
