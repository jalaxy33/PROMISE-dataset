<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been developing with Java for over three years 
now, and am</DIV>
<DIV>currently involved in an extensive web project which has relied 
heavily</DIV>
<DIV>on log4j.&nbsp; In fact, given the intricacies of web program and the</DIV>
<DIV>sometimes unexpected behavior inherent in asynchronous programming, I</DIV>
<DIV>would not have been able to successfully fix some of the most subtle</DIV>
<DIV>bugs had it not been for log4j.&nbsp; The fact that it is used as a 
standard</DIV>
<DIV>logging package in many Apache projects, upon which I heavily rely,</DIV>
<DIV>lends credence to its stability and ease of mind to developers who 
have</DIV>
<DIV>enough to worry about with meeting deadlines.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you take great care in treating this issue, and 
make it known</DIV>
<DIV>within the Sun community that log4j would be a valuable asset in the</DIV>
<DIV>Java arsenal.</DIV><BR>
