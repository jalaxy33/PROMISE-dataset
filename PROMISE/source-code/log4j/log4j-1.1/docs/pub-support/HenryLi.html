<DIV>I don't know how many companies are using Log4J. I extended the log4j 
for</DIV>
<DIV>our company and the extension is now used as one of our companies</DIV>
<DIV>enterprise components. Log4J is so easy to use, easy to extend and easy 
to</DIV>
<DIV>configure. I don't see any reason that sun should recreate a logging 
API</DIV>
<DIV>which does the exact same thing.</DIV>
