<DIV>Dear Members of JSR47:</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I'm working in a big group of Java developers. Previously the lack of</DIV>
<DIV>logging solution forced us to develop a custom logging API for our</DIV>
<DIV>internal needs. Our logging framework borrowed some ideas from 
logging</DIV>
<DIV>facilities from old Borland's C++, there were some of the features 
that</DIV>
<DIV>we later found in log4j, and some our own. Nevertheless, close</DIV>
<DIV>examination of the Log4J made us migrate to it, and we never 
regretted.</DIV>
<DIV>The framework is easy to use, provides very good set of features, and</DIV>
<DIV>fast.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I strongly support arguments of the Log4J's founder at</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A>. In 
particular, my</DIV>
<DIV>experience shows that the long list of log levels introduces only</DIV>
<DIV>confusion, especially when working in a group . For example, how do 
you</DIV>
<DIV>define the difference between FINE, FINER and FINEST, for a new</DIV>
<DIV>programmer in your project?</DIV><BR>
<DIV>As you know Log4J is widely used. It is a part of many open source 
and</DIV>
<DIV>commercial projects. What would you suggest for all the people 
working</DIV>
<DIV>on these projects, assuming the current discrepancies between the new</DIV>
<DIV>standard suggested in JSR47 and existing de-facto standard in 
Log4J?</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Personally I think that introducing Log4J as logging API of new JDK 
will</DIV>
<DIV>be beneficial for all the Java community. This would save time for 
those</DIV>
<DIV>developers who otherwise would have to migrate their code, and would</DIV>
<DIV>have positive impact on the quality of Java projects. E.g. in a</DIV>
<DIV>medium-to-big project that would use several solutions from different</DIV>
<DIV>vendors or open source projects, developers we may end up having two</DIV>
<DIV>different logging APIs to work with in the same project (!). </DIV><BR>
<DIV>Adopting Log4J as the standard logging API would show that Sun does 
care</DIV>
<DIV>about the quality of the Java platform and its APIs, and that it does</DIV>
<DIV>care about developers who selected this platform and support it.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I personally know that throwing own work away is difficult. But don't</DIV>
<DIV>you think that it is TOO LATE to introduce a NEW logging API, when</DIV>
<DIV>there's EXISTING one, which is widely adopted and proved itself very</DIV>
<DIV>well?</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thank you for your time reading this.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Regards</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Alexander Evsukov</DIV>
