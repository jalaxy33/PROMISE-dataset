<DIV>I am writing because I am concerned about the proposed logging tools 
that</DIV>
<DIV>will be included in the JDK1.4, that is, JSR47. I have been using log4j, 
and</DIV>
<DIV>I have found it to be a powerful tool that is easy to understand and use. 
I</DIV>
<DIV>think it would be a shame if sun was to ignore the criticisms of JSR47 
found</DIV>
<DIV>at <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A></DIV><BR>
<DIV>I think the selection process of new apis to be included in the jdk 
should</DIV>
<DIV>be biased to choose existing, proven working libraries such as log4j, 
which</DIV>
<DIV>people already use and know, and in particular, that log4j should be 
used</DIV>
<DIV>instead of this JSR47 proposal.</DIV><BR>
