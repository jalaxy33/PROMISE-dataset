<DIV>Hi,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; I have only recently started using a logging api and was thrilled 
when I found log4j. It is simple to use and considering the number of us already 
using it, well tested. I especially appreciate that it is easily extendable to 
my own uses and that it leaves the smallest footprint on my code. It gives me 
complete control over extending it and how and where I output my information. I 
also am very interested in configuring logging at a particular hierarchy 
and&nbsp; not letting configuration at too high a level overwrite some of the 
lower level logging that I may be most interested in at a given time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; Please reconsider shaping jsr47 to log4j. We are a lot of happy 
customers and would like to see the jdk1.4 composed of the best apis.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; Thanx for your time,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
