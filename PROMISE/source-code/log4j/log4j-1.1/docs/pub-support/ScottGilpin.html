<DIV>I understand that JDK v1.4 will be shipped with a new</DIV>
<DIV>logging api.&nbsp; I've been using Log4J from the Jakarta</DIV>
<DIV>project for quite some time now.&nbsp; Although these two</DIV>
<DIV>api's are very similar, it doesn't make sense to me as</DIV>
<DIV>to why sun would "reinvent the wheel".&nbsp;&nbsp; Log4J has</DIV>
<DIV>been around for quite some time, and developers have</DIV>
<DIV>been quite satisfied with it.&nbsp; I would urge your team</DIV>
<DIV>to please consider using Log4J as the standard logging</DIV>
<DIV>api - I don't see any reason for Sun to compete with</DIV>
<DIV>something that is already considered the industry</DIV>
<DIV>standard.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thank you,</DIV>
