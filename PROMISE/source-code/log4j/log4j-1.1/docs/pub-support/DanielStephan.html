<DIV>Hi,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I just read Ceki Gülcü's page at <A 
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A>,</DIV>
<DIV>and would like to tell you my concern about your logging solution. I 
totally agree with Ceki.</DIV>
<DIV>Log4J is not just plain better, but widely used in the industry. Most 
people I have</DIV>
<DIV>talked to really like Log4J, some are right enthusiastic about it. With a 
reason imho.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Replacing the API should not be too much work, because it is already there 
and working.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>It might be hard for you to just throw something away what you have worked 
on for</DIV>
<DIV>so many hours, but at the end it is just better to switch. Because you and 
Sun and Java</DIV>
<DIV>and the whole Java community will benefit from a well working logging 
solution being</DIV>
<DIV>part of Java 1.4.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Please realize that most developers won't use your Logging API anyway, they 
will stay with</DIV>
<DIV>Log4J because they like it. It is just plain better for everyone if you 
switch.</DIV><BR><BR>
<DIV>Pleeeeeeeease :-)</DIV><BR><BR>
<DIV>Best regards,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Daniel Stephan</DIV><BR><BR>
