<DIV>I appreciate all of the effort you've put in on this JSR.&nbsp; However, 
I'm</DIV>
<DIV>sure if you take a step back you will agree with the severity of its</DIV>
<DIV>problems.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I think most importantly is that it requires the JDK 1.4.&nbsp; This is 
absurd!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;I can't imagine what the JDK1.3 (let alone 1.1) is missing as far 
as</DIV>
<DIV>handling logging statements.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>There's a lot of 1.1 development still going on.&nbsp; I don't suggest 
we</DIV>
<DIV>cripple new APIs to support it, but you might as well be compatible 
if</DIV>
<DIV>possible!</DIV><BR>
<DIV>thanks,</DIV>

<DIV>&gt; Court,</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; </DIV>
<DIV>&gt; Thanks for your interest in the logging APIs.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; </DIV>
<DIV>&gt; As Ceki noted, IBM has been a very active participant in the</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; JSR-047 logging JSR.&nbsp; When the logging JSR was initiated in</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; January 2000, IBM had both the log4j work at IBM research and</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; the JLog work at IBM Tivoli.&nbsp; The Tivoli work built on 
IBM's</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; earlier product logging experience and included features like</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; internationalization that were then not present in log4j.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; IBM's involvement in JSR-047 was focused on their JLog</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; experience which had seen a lot of use in IBM products.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; </DIV>
<DIV>&gt; However, Ceki also provided useful input from log4j, and that</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; has influenced some parts of the logging APIs.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; </DIV>
<DIV>&gt; In designing the APIs we've tried to draw from numerous</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; sources and we've tried to support a wide set of requirements.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; It's inevitable that when there is a new standardization</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; effort it will make some different choices from some of</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; the existing APIs.&nbsp; We went through a similar experience</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; with JDBC.&nbsp; It build on a bunch of earlier work, but it</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; wasn't exactly like any of them.&nbsp; Unfortunately we delayed</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; adding a JDK logging API for too long, and I think it</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; is important that we resolve that in Merlin.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; </DIV>
<DIV>&gt; Unfortunately we are quite late in the Merlin cycle and</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; we can't really accommodate major API changes at this point.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; However, I will be studying Ceki's comments carefully.</DIV>

<DIV>&gt; &gt; It is a critique of the JSR47 logging system, to be included in 
the</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; JDK</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; 1.4.&nbsp; I agree with the author that the log4j api should be 
adopted</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; instead.</DIV>
