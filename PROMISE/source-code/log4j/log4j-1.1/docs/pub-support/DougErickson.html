<DIV>Hi JSR47 Folks -- </DIV><BR>
<DIV>One of the main things I've been looking forward to in the release of</DIV>
<DIV>JDK 1.4 is the logging API.&nbsp; I'm familiar with log4j, which has filled 
a</DIV>
<DIV>big void in our development.&nbsp; At first glance, it seems that the</DIV>
<DIV>"standard" logging API uses the same concepts.&nbsp; On closer 
inspection</DIV>
<DIV>though, several drawbacks are revealed.&nbsp; The log4j guys, as I'm 
sure</DIV>
<DIV>you're aware, do a good job of describing these gaps</DIV>
<DIV>(<A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A>).</DIV><BR>
<DIV>To me, it seems like the main problems could be avoided by linking 
child</DIV>
<DIV>to parent as log4j does.&nbsp; Isn't this an implementation detail?&nbsp; 
Why</DIV>
<DIV>can't it be changed?&nbsp; </DIV><BR>
<DIV>I realize now that 1.4 beta is out the door, all this is probably moot. 
</DIV>
<DIV>Consider this, however:&nbsp; you know you need to get the logging API 
out</DIV>
<DIV>there, right?&nbsp; Because it's long overdue... Well, it's ALREADY</DIV>
<DIV>_too_late_!&nbsp; People didn't sit around waiting for the JCP to do 
its</DIV>
<DIV>thing -- we had software to write!&nbsp; So by ignoring that established 
base</DIV>
<DIV>of log4j users, I think you're risking the perceived integrity of the</DIV>
<DIV>JCP.&nbsp; It'd be better to spend the next six months finding more 
common</DIV>
<DIV>ground with this significant group of log4j users.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thanks for your consideration,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Doug Erickson</DIV>
