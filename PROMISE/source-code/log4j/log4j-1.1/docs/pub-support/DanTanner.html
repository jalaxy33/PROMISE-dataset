<DIV>My background is:</DIV>
<DIV>I currently use log4j.&nbsp; I don't have any personal attachments to 
it.&nbsp; There</DIV>
<DIV>is room for improvement for it, but it has become a well-honed tool 
for</DIV>
<DIV>logging through heavy use and development, and I hope you remain as open 
as</DIV>
<DIV>possible in making the best of the proposed spec and log4j.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I think you need to:</DIV>
<DIV>- Do performance comparisons between your latest implementation and 
log4j.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>- Provide a response to Ceki Gülcü's critique on a point-by-point basis, 
and</DIV>
<DIV>make it publicly available for further responses from those currently 
using</DIV>
<DIV>some sort of logging tool.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>i.e. Do you agree with each point?&nbsp; If not, why?</DIV><BR><BR>
<DIV>This component will be especially important to Sun's image for supporters 
as</DIV>
<DIV>well as competitors.&nbsp; If successful, it will show the immense value of 
open</DIV>
<DIV>community involvement in creating the best software.&nbsp; It is a 
huge</DIV>
<DIV>opportunity to show that you mean what you say.&nbsp; If unsuccessful, 
it'll look</DIV>
<DIV>like the bickering that occurs too often in the linux community.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Therefore, I urge you once again to think carefully and openly to 
make</DIV>
<DIV>java.util.logging a utility people are happy to embrace.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thanks.</DIV>
