<DIV>Hi</DIV><BR>
<DIV>At the outset I would like to say that this is a personal request and 
not</DIV>
<DIV>one from the company I work for. I don't represent the company at all 
in</DIV>
<DIV>this matter nor the company shares this view.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Sun seems to behave more and more like Microsoft by putting in more and 
more</DIV>
<DIV>functionality in the java core programming language. On the whole this 
may</DIV>
<DIV>help but most of the times this involves reinventing the wheel. </DIV>
<DIV>Sun has been consistent in criticizing Microsoft along with a host of 
others</DIV>
<DIV>on the integration that they keep doing with their Windows OS starting 
with</DIV>
<DIV>browsers and now with media players and personal firewalls in the 
upcoming</DIV>
<DIV>version of Windows XP... One consequence of this integration&nbsp; is that 
other</DIV>
<DIV>third party software companies often find themselves out of business - 
like</DIV>
<DIV>Netscape for instance and a host of other small ones.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I would like Sun to stop reinventing the wheel and instead integrate 
the</DIV>
<DIV>logging API from log4j into jdk 1.4 that will make older software easier 
to</DIV>
<DIV>integrate and show Sun's commitment to Open Source and differentiate 
Sun</DIV>
<DIV>from Microsoft.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>regards</DIV><BR>
