<DIV>As a java software developer I'm deeply concerned in the process of</DIV>
<DIV>logging. That is from my point of view one of the only way to 
diagnose</DIV>
<DIV>an on-site running application.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I had a deep look on <A 
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html" 
EUDORA="AUTOURL">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</A></DIV><BR>
<DIV>Even, if not using Log4j for reasons far enough from this mail, I do</DIV>
<DIV>agree on most of the arguments shown on this page.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I urge you not to use levels as FINE, FINER, FINEST. Even if it seems 
a</DIV>
<DIV>good idea, it becomes a nightmare for someone to decide what the 
level</DIV>
<DIV>of a log should be.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>The proposition FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO and DEBUG is enough. We do 
use</DIV>
<DIV>those levels, and only those levels.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Logging to only one logger at a time has announced in this page, is 
not</DIV>
<DIV>enough. We do use several loggers at a time, for different purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>These feature is a must have.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>The error handling feature of log4j is consistent : a logger must me</DIV>
<DIV>silent !</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Logging is one of the toughest algorithmic subject with error 
handling</DIV>
<DIV>and software configuration in nowadays software.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I feel that trying to get THE API for logging is some kind of 
nonsense.</DIV>
<DIV>Just look what you may find, each has a distinct standard way</DIV>
<DIV>WindowsXXX, Unix, VMS, ...</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Good tools are more important that bad API. So I do say : "leave 
logging</DIV>
<DIV>in the wild, focus on other important subjects that are not to bring</DIV>
<DIV>religious war".</DIV><BR>
