to conform to log4j <BR></SPAN><SPAN class=EUDORAHEADER>To:

<DIV>Dear Sir or Madam,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I'd like to request that the current design of JSR47,</DIV>
<DIV>the Java Logging API be revised to be closer to that</DIV>
<DIV>of log4j (now hosted by the Apache project,) or</DIV>
<DIV>replaced by log4j outright.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>It has been my experience that projects accepted for</DIV>
<DIV>inclusion in the Apache project have always been</DIV>
<DIV>outstanding for their performance, lack of defects and</DIV>
<DIV>attention to detail. I cite specific examples from my</DIV>
<DIV>own projects: Jakarta-Tomcat which I have running on 4</DIV>
<DIV>different platforms with no downtime. Ant which is a</DIV>
<DIV>superior build environment, and the Xerces XML parser</DIV>
<DIV>suite. All of these have become part of nearly every</DIV>
<DIV>Java web developer's toolkit and rightly so.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Log4j shows this same level of quality as the other</DIV>
<DIV>Apache projects. I think it will become a developer's</DIV>
<DIV>toolbox inductee very soon. As it stands currently, it</DIV>
<DIV>commands a great deal of Java programmer's mindshare. </DIV><BR><BR>
<DIV>Sun Microsystems traditionally develops superior grade</DIV>
<DIV>products. I believe the new Java Community Process</DIV>
<DIV>goes a long way toward opening up the Java platform</DIV>
<DIV>for input from its best supporters, its customers, the</DIV>
<DIV>millions of Java programmers. I am proud of the work</DIV>
<DIV>to include Generic Java and the Assertion model into</DIV>
<DIV>upcoming releases of the language. These meet major</DIV>
<DIV>needs of the development community.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>To include an untested logging API where a robust</DIV>
<DIV>tested one exists and is supported by a large</DIV>
<DIV>community, is unwise at best.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>The JCP should look deeper into this dilemma before</DIV>
<DIV>adopting JSR47 as it now stands into the JDK 1.4</DIV>
<DIV>specification.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thank you for listening.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Sincerely.</DIV><BR>
