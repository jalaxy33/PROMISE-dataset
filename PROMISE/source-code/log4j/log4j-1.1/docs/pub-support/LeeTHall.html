<DIV>Please hear my concern.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I have been a Sun Certified Java Programmer and Developer for four 
years.</DIV>
<DIV>Prior to that, I have been a professional C/UNIX programmer since 
1983.&nbsp; I</DIV>
<DIV>am presently serving BankOne as an IT architect in the Retail Systems</DIV>
<DIV>department.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I state these facts to qualify my objection to what appears to be 
blatant</DIV>
<DIV>disregard of the pragmatic Java community adoption and ad hoc</DIV>
<DIV>standardization on the log4j toolkit that has become a Jakarta 
project.</DIV>
<DIV>Innovation and technology evangelism should be rewarded by recognition 
and</DIV>
<DIV>endorsement - not by formal rejection by a committee (even by one 
which</DIV>
<DIV>acts with a certain amount of authority).</DIV><BR>
<DIV>It seems hard to believe that anyone who has a sincere interest in adding 
a</DIV>
<DIV>logging API to the Java2 SDK could possibly ignore the 
org.apache.log4j</DIV>
<DIV>package.&nbsp; Unless the JCP expert group is actually trying to 
cause</DIV>
<DIV>deliberate confusion in the community, they should simply recognize 
that</DIV>
<DIV>log4j has become the ad hoc standard and move on to endorsement.&nbsp; It 
will</DIV>
<DIV>cause the community considerable inconvenience to need to "port" their 
code</DIV>
<DIV>to the result of JSR47 unless there is substantial reason to do so.</DIV>
<DIV>Further, it will cause even more confusion in organizations that need 
to</DIV>
<DIV>support current and older versions of the JDK.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I, for one, will continue to use and endorse the use of log4j 
regardless.</DIV>
<DIV>It is my strong professional opinion that JSR47 should be terminated with 
a</DIV>
<DIV>final report that is an acknowledgement that the community at-large 
has</DIV>
<DIV>already chosen to standardize on log4j.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Sincerely,</DIV><BR>
