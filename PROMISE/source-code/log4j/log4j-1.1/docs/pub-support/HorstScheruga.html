<DIV>First of all I want to thank you guys for Java.</DIV>
<DIV>You have done a very good job in consolidating the API's.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>The point why I am writing you, is about the logging API, that will 
come</DIV>
<DIV>with JDK 1.4.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Logging and Tracing is a thing that everyone needs and bringing it up 
with</DIV>
<DIV>JDK1.4 is very late!</DIV><BR>
<DIV>So meanwhile a lot of Tracing classes has been written. One of the 
most</DIV>
<DIV>advanced are the ones developed by the Jarkata group within 
Log4J.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>So I would strongly recommend to contact this guys for bringing out</DIV>
<DIV>combinded API.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>To say that is to late now is ones oppinion.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>My opinion is it would be to late after you started a dispute by 
bringing</DIV>
<DIV>out an unconsolidated API!!!</DIV><BR>
<DIV>So please keep going on doing that good job!</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Thanks!</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Best regards</DIV>
