size=2>The founder of log4j raises some valid concerns about JSR47 in his open 
article located at:</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html</FONT> 
<BR><BR><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>I do not support log4j becoming a 
replacement for JSR47 because I think that the log4j API needs to be cleaned up 
and made more user-friendly for simple logging tasks. I think that JSR47 has 
made improvements in this area. However, very careful attention should be paid 
to issues regarding performance, error handling, and interoperability prior to 
finalizing the proposed API. Specifically:</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT face=sans-serif 
size=2>1) More effort should be spent optimizing the specification so that it 
does not become yet another Java performance burden. For example, parameters to 
the logging methods in JSR47 are always evaluated. Frequently the evaluation of 
these parameters results in new and expensive object allocations... which is 
unnecessary when logging is disabled. The typical solution is to wrap wrap every 
logging method with an if statement that determines whether logging is enabled. 
This is inconvenient and will therefore be difficult to enforce in practice. I 
suggest investigating ways to perform conditional evaluation of parameters, 
perhaps borrowing from work done for the assertion facility in JSR41.</FONT> 
<BR><BR><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>2) The addition of logging should not 
affect an application's behavior (i.e. it should not introduce new Errors or 
Exceptions).</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>3) I'd like to see more 
focused collaboration between JSR47 and the J2EE community. There is an active 
and unresolved discussion about how to achieve high-performance J2EE-compliant 
debugging. I'm not sure that JSR47 in its current form addresses this 
issue.</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT face=sans-serif size=2>Piper</FONT>
