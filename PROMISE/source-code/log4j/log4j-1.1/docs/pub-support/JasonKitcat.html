<DIV>Hello,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>While a happy Java user for many years it seems incredible that you have 
ignored all the work and community support behind log4j (let alone it's 
technical superiority) to create a new product.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Of particular concern to us at the FREE e-democracy project is that 
GNU.FREE is backwards compatible with as many version of the JVM as possible. 
The fact that log4j supports 1.1 upwards and JSR47 will only work with 1.4 
upwards indicates that we never be able to consider your propose 
alternative.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>Please withdraw it and join the community, I'm sure there's lots you could 
contribute to the log4j team.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>All the best,</DIV>
<DIV>Jason</DIV><BR>
