<DIV>To the JSR 47 Expert Group</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I would like to support most of the points made by Ceki in his </DIV>
<DIV>review of the proposed Merlin logging API at </DIV><BR>
<DIV><X-TAB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</X-TAB><A

<DIV>and I would urge the committee to reconsider.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>In particular:</DIV><BR>
<DIV>o Logging API should be designed so that configuration order does </DIV>
<DIV>not matter.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>o Bogus levels</DIV><BR>
<DIV>o Limited Functionality - this could be addressed using optional </DIV>
<DIV>pluggable extensions in javax.logging, some of which could be </DIV>
<DIV>supplied with J2EE, such as JMS and XML logging support. Better </DIV>
<DIV>pluggability should be provided.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>o Error Handling</DIV><BR>
<DIV>On Parents and Children, I have not investigated the inheritance </DIV>
<DIV>structure as described, however I would emphasis the need for </DIV>
<DIV>extensibility in such a fundamental API, with respect to function, </DIV>
<DIV>internationalisation, customisation and so forth. </DIV><BR>
<DIV>On the basis of my own brief investigation:</DIV><BR>
<DIV>o Pluggability does not seem to be well addressed. It seems </DIV>
<DIV>symptomatic that there is only one interface defined in the API, </DIV>
<DIV>and no distinction between User and Service Provider classes. I </DIV>
<DIV>view pluggability as fundamental. </DIV><BR>
<DIV>o It appears that you can't have multiple (named) instances of </DIV>
<DIV>handlers such as FileHandler and SocketHandler with different </DIV>
<DIV>physical destinations.</DIV><BR>
<DIV>I would emphasise the need for flexible configuration, which goes </DIV>
<DIV>hand in hand with pluggability. Different frameworks, such as third </DIV>
<DIV>party APIs, will have their own logging requirements and it should </DIV>
<DIV>be possible to integrate the logging according to the needs of the </DIV>
<DIV>integrator.</DIV><BR>
