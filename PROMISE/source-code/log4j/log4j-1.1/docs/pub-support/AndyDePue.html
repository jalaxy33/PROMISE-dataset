<DIV>Hello,</DIV><BR>
<DIV>&nbsp; I have been involved on at least ten projects where logging has 
been</DIV>
<DIV>necessary.&nbsp; With this much experience logging (both building 
logging</DIV>
<DIV>libraries and using third party libraries), I can tell you that when 
I</DIV>
<DIV>discovered log4j, I had never seen anything like it.&nbsp; It is, simply, 
the</DIV>
<DIV>best logging package I have ever used.&nbsp; Not just the big things, but 
the</DIV>
<DIV>little details are what make it great.&nbsp; After a thorough review of JSR 
47,</DIV>
<DIV>I see it falls short on many of these details.&nbsp; In all honesty, if 
JSR47</DIV>
<DIV>became the logging standard, I would never use it as long as log4j 
still</DIV>
<DIV>existed in an up-to-date state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; Please have mercy on us developers and heed this appeal!</DIV><BR>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
