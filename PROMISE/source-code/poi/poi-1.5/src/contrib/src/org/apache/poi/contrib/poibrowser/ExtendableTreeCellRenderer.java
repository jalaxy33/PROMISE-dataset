/**
 * <p>This is a {@link TreeCellRenderer} implementation which is able
 * to render arbitrary objects. The {@link ExtendableTreeCellRenderer}
 * does not do the rendering itself but instead dispatches to
 * class-specific renderers. A class/renderer pair must be registered
 * using the {@link #register} method. If a class has no registered
 * renderer, the renderer of its closest superclass is used. Since the
 * {@link ExtendableTreeCellRenderer} always has a default renderer
 * for the {@link Object} class, rendering is always possible. The
 * default {@link Object} renderer can be replaced by another renderer
 * but it cannot be unregistered.</p>
