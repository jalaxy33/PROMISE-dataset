/**
 * Represents an FKP data structure. This data structure is used to store the
 * grpprls of the paragraph and character properties of the document. A grpprl
 * is a list of sprms(decompression operations) to perform on a parent style.
 *
 * The style properties for paragraph and character runs
 * are stored in fkps. There are PAP fkps for paragraph properties and CHP fkps
 * for character run properties. The first part of the fkp for both CHP and PAP
 * fkps consists of an array of 4 byte int offsets in the main stream for that
 * Paragraph's or Character run's text. The ending offset is the next
 * value in the array. For example, if an fkp has X number of Paragraph's
 * stored in it then there are (x + 1) 4 byte ints in the beginning array. The
 * number X is determined by the last byte in a 512 byte fkp.
 *
 * CHP and PAP fkps also store the compressed styles(grpprl) that correspond to
 * the offsets on the front of the fkp. The offset of the grpprls is determined
 * differently for CHP fkps and PAP fkps.
