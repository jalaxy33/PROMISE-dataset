/**
 * <p>Organizes document information in a tree model in order to be
 * e.g. displayed in a Swing {@link JTree}. An instance of this class
 * is created with a root tree node ({@link MutableTreeNode}) and
 * registered as a {@link POIFSReaderListener} with a {@link
 * POIFSReader}. While the latter processes a POI filesystem it calls
 * this class' {@link #processPOIFSReaderEvent} for each document it
 * has been registered for. This method appends the document it
 * processes at the appropriate position into the tree rooted at the
 * above mentioned root tree node.</p>
 *
 * <p>The root tree node should be the root tree node of a {@link
 * TreeModel}.</p>
 *
 * <p>A top-level element in the tree model, i.e. an immediate child
 * node of the root node, describes a POI filesystem as such. It is
 * suggested to use the file's name (as seen by the operating system)
 * but it could be any other string.</p>
 *
 * <p>The value of a tree node is a {@link DocumentDescriptor}. Unlike
 * a {@link POIFSDocument} which may be as heavy as many megabytes, an
 * instance of {@link DocumentDescriptor} is a light-weight object and
 * contains only some meta-information about a document.</p>
